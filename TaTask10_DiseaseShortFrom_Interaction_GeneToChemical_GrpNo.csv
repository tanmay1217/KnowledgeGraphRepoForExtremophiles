Significance: The results shed light on the mechanism of marine elastin degradation.;  It is still unclear how marine elastin is degraded because of the limited study of marine elastases.;  Pseudoalterin has a narrow specificity but high activity toward elastin.;  Analysis of the cleavage sites of pseudoalterin on elastin showed that pseudoalterin cleaves the glycyl bonds in hydrophobic regions and the peptide bonds Ala–Ala, Ala–Lys, and Lys–Ala involved in cross-linking.;  Two peptic derivatives of desmosine, desmosine-Ala-Ala and desmosine-Ala-Ala-Ala, were detected in the elastin hydrolysate, indicating that pseudoalterin can dissociate cross-linked elastin.;  These results reveal a new elastolytic mechanism of the M23 protease pseudoalterin, which is different from the reported mechanism where the M23 proteases only cleave glycyl bonds in elastin.;  Genome analysis suggests that M23 proteases may be popular in deep-sea sediments, implying their important role in elastin degradation.;  An elastin degradation model of pseudoalterin was proposed, based on these results and scanning electron microscopic analysis of the degradation by pseudoalterin of bovine elastin and cross-linked recombinant tropoelastin.;  Our results shed light on the mechanism of elastin degradation in deep-sea sediment.;  On this basis, elastin represents an important component of marine organic nitrogen, and its degradation cannot be ignored for marine nitrogen recycling.; The formation of elastin is classically characterized by four stages as follows: tropoelastin synthesis and secretion, association through coacervation, deposition on microfibrils, and cross-linking (2).;  Tropoelastin is the precursor of elastin whose sequence contains two major types of domains, hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions.;  Secreted tropoelastin molecules are ∼15-nm asymmetric monomers that aggregate on the cell surface to form spherules through coacervation by hydrophobic interactions (3–6).;  In vitro observation of coacervated recombinant tropoelastin has demonstrated that this association is a noncovalent process that can by reversed by simple changes in environmental conditions such as temperature and salt (7).;  Lysine residues on the massed tropoelastin spherules are oxidized and polymerized to bi-, tri-, and tetrafunctional cross-links, including desmosine (DES)2 and isodesmosine (IDE), to form native elastin networks with the participation of lysyl oxidase (8).;  Various sizes of tropoelastin aggregates before being cross-linked have been identified in vitro, ranging from ∼200 nm to 2–6 μm (2, 5, 9, 10).;  However, the precise details of elastin assembly in vivo are still unclear.; Human tropoelastin is translated from a single gene and spliced to multiple isoforms.;  Exon 26A is a unique domain in human elastin that is usually spliced out in healthy elastic tissue and is occasionally retained under damaged elastin conditions (11).;  Tropoelastin SHELdelta26A corresponding to amino acid residues 27–724 of GenBankTM entry {""type"":""entrez-protein"",""attrs"":{""text"":""AAC98394"",""term_id"":""182020""}}AAC98394 (gi182020) is an isoform of synthetic human elastin without domain 26A.;  Tropoelastin SHELdelta26A can reversibly associate by coacervation at suitable temperature, concentration, NaCl concentration, and pH (12).;  Additionally, chemical cross-linker bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (BS3) has been used to cross-link the SHELdelta26A tropoelastin to study the structural features of tropoelastin monomer (10).; Because of their insoluble and highly cross-linked nature, elastin is resistant to most proteases, except for a limited number of elastases.;  For this reason, the mechanism of marine elastin degradation remains unclear.;  For this reason, elastin is recognized as a preferred substrate for the M23 proteases because there are ∼33% glycine residues in the tropoelastin sequence (33).;  Moreover, the elastolytic mechanism of pseudoalterin was studied in detail by biochemical experiments and through SEM observations, thus revealing that pseudoalterin digests elastin effectively by a mechanism that is distinct from the reported M23 proteases.;  The results help to clarify the degradation mechanism of deep-sea sedimentary elastin.;  Insoluble type I collagen fiber (bovine achilles tendon) was purchased from Worthington. α-casein, gamma globulin, elastinorcein, BS3, and bovine neck ligament elastin isoform 1 (SwissProt accession number {""type"":""entrez-protein"",""attrs"":{""text"":""P04985"",""term_id"":""119293""}}P04985–1) (hereafter called bovine elastin) were purchased from Sigma, and gelatin was from Boston Biomedical Inc.;  CF6-2 was cultured at 15 °C for 48 h in the fermentation medium containing 0.2% (w/w) yeast extract, 0.3% (w/w) bovine elastin, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm Na2HPO4, and artificial seawater (pH 8.0).;  One unit of elastinolytic activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that increased 0.01 unit of absorbance at 590 nm/min.; Bovine elastin (10 mg) was incubated with pseudoalterin (10 μg) in 0.5 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0) at 25 °C with continuous stirring.;  Bovine elastin in the same buffer without pseudoalterin served as negative controls.; Soluble products from pseudoalterin digestion of 10 mg of elastin were boiled for 10 min to terminate the reaction and loaded onto LC-MS to analyze the molecular masses of the released peptides.; Twenty milligrams of bovine elastin was mixed with 20 μg of pseudoalterin in 500 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0).;  The same treatment with BSA instead of bovine elastin served as controls.; Recombinant human tropoelastin isoform SHELdelta26A was purified as described previously (12, 45).;  Tropoelastin was dissolved to 10 mg/ml in 10 mm phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4).;  The cross-linked tropoelastin was washed with the PBS repeatedly, followed by hydrolysis with 0.1 mg/ml pseudoalterin for 10 and 15 min at 25 °C.; Five milligrams of bovine elastin was mixed with 10 μg of pseudoalterin in 200 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), and the mixture was incubated at 25 °C with continuous stirring for different times.;  The specific activity of pseudoalterin toward elastinorcein at 25 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0) was quite high.;  The activity of pseudoalterin toward elastinorcein was detectable over a broad range from pH 7 to 11 with a maximal activity at pH 9.5, whereas the optimal temperature of pseudoalterin was 25 °C (supplemental Fig.;  Pseudoalterin appeared to require zinc ion for its hydrolytic activity as 1 mm 1,10-phenanthroline completely abolished its activity against elastinorcein.;  The half-life was the time that it took to eliminate 50% of the activity of pseudoalterin with elastinorcein at a given temperature.; b The optimum pH was determined by measuring the activities of pseudoalterin with elastinorcein (30 °C) in Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4 buffer at pH values ranging from 6.5 to 8, barbital sodium/HCl buffer at pH values ranging from 7.5 to 9.6, and NaHCO3/NaOH buffer ranging from 9.6 to 11.0.; c The optimum temperature was determined by measuring the activities of pseudoalterin with elastinorcein in 50 mm Tris buffer (pH 9.0) or in artificial sea water at temperatures ranging from 0 to 45 °C.; a Elastolytic activity of pseudoalterin was measured at 25 °C for elastinorcein.; b Pseudoalterin was incubated with each inhibitor at 25 °C for 20 min, and then the enzyme activity was measured at 25 °C for elastinorcein.;  Pseudoalterin had very high activity toward elastinorcein (528 units/mg), much higher than pseudolysin and myroilysin.;  Except for elastin, pseudoalterin showed little hydrolysis of any other proteins that were tested, including casein, type I collagen fibers, fibrin, and gamma-globulin (Table 3 and supplemental Fig.; Fig. 2 revealed that pseudoalterin displayed high hydrolytic activity toward bovine elastin.;  When incubated at 25 °C, 10 mg of bovine elastin was visually degraded by 10 μg of pseudoalterin within 4 h (Fig. 2A).;  After treatment for 1 h, the elastin swelled, and numerous filaments were released, and these filaments were further degraded into smaller segments with further treatment time (Fig. 2B).; Hydrolysis of bovine elastin by pseudoalterin.;  Ten milligrams of bovine elastin in 0.5 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0) containing 10 μg of pseudoalterin was incubated at 25 °C with continuous stirring.;  Bovine elastin in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0) without pseudoalterin served as the negative control.;  A, macroscopic observation of the hydrolysis of bovine elastin by pseudoalterin.;  B, light microscopic observation of hydrolysis of bovine elastin by pseudoalterin after 1 and 2 h.; To further analyze the elastolytic mechanism of pseudoalterin, its cleavage sites on bovine elastin were analyzed (supplemental Fig.;  Twenty seven peptides released from bovine elastin by pseudoalterin digestion were separated, and their molecular masses and sequences were identified.;  Based on the sequences of these peptides, 32 cleavage sites on bovine elastin were determined (supplemental Table S3).;  Furthermore, a cleavage site Ala↓ Lys in the hydrophilic domain involved in cross-linking in elastin was also detected, which has not been reported for any other M23 protease.; To confirm the cleavage sites analyzed above, based on the sequence of bovine tropoelastin in the database (SwissProt accession number P04985-1), four peptides (GVGVAP, IGGGAGG, GIGLGP, and PGAGARF) in the hydrophobic regions and two typical peptides (AAAKAA and AAAAAKAAAK) in the hydrophilic regions were synthesized to assess their efficacy as potential substrates for pseudoalterin.;  This result confirmed the cleavage sites analyzed above and indicated that pseudoalterin can cleave the peptide bonds Ala-Ala and Lys-Ala in the hydrophilic regions in elastin.; DES is a cross-link that is characteristic of elastin (8).;  If pseudoalterin can break down the cross-links in elastin by cleaving the peptide bonds Ala–Ala, Ala–Lys, and/or Lys–Ala in the hydrophilic regions, then DES and/or peptic derivatives of DES with one or more alanine residues, such as DES-Ala, DES-Ala-Ala, DES-Ala-Ala-Ala, or DES-Ala-Ala-Ala-Ala, would be released in the elastin hydrolysate.;  To test this hypothesis, elastin hydrolysates were analyzed by LC-MS.;  Because the long peptides in the elastin hydrolysate were removed before LC-MS analysis, a subset of compounds was detected in the mass spectrum of the elastin hydrolysate.;  Among these peaks, two abundant ions were m/z 669.5 and m/z 740.5, representing the masses of DES-Ala-Ala and DES-Ala-Ala-Ala, respectively (Fig. 4B), indicating that DES-Ala-Ala and DES-Ala-Ala-Ala were released from bovine elastin by pseudoalterin.; LC-MS analysis of peptic derivatives of DES in the elastin hydrolysate released by pseudoalterin.
A, mass spectrum of DES standard.;  B, mass spectrum of elastin hydrolysate.;  Twenty milligrams of bovine elastin was degraded by 20 μg of pseudoalterin at 25 °C for 36 h followed by addition of 500 μl of 4% sulfosalicylic acid to remove the long peptides.; On this basis, the cleavage sites of pseudoalterin on bovine tropoelastin are shown in Fig. 5.;  These cleavage sites indicate that pseudoalterin can cleave the peptide bonds both in the hydrophilic regions and in the hydrophobic regions to effectively degrade insoluble elastin.; Cleavage sites by pseudoalterin on bovine tropoelastin (SwissProt accession number P04985-1).;  Cleavage sites were determined by analysis of the sequences of peptides released by pseudoalterin from bovine elastin as shown in supplemental Table S3, and the cleavage sites of pseudoalterin on six peptides were synthesized according to the sequence of bovine tropoelastin as shown in Fig. 3.; To model the degradation of elastin by pseudoalterin, human tropoelastin was expressed and purified and then chemically cross-linked in vitro.;  After cross-linking, the tropoelastin spherules were linked into clusters or filaments like beads on a string under SEM (Fig. 6A).;  When the cross-linked tropoelastin spherules were incubated with pseudoalterin for 10 min, physical contacts between the spherules dissipated or fractured (Fig. 6B).;  After 15 min of incubation, most clusters separated into single spherules (Fig. 6C), and some spherules began to reveal ∼15 nm substructures, i.e. the size of tropoelastin monomers (Fig. 6D).;  These observations revealed that pseudoalterin was capable of proteolytically attacking a synthetic elastin model where no other substrate was present other than that which contained target elastolytic sequences, regardless of the fact that it was cross-linked.; Degradation of recombinant tropoelastin cross-linking clusters by pseudoalterin.
A, 10 mg/ml tropoelastin following incubation with 10 mm BS3 in 10 mm PBS for 30 min.; To further understand the degradation mechanism of pseudoalterin on elastin, the process was observed by SEM.;  Bovine elastin is composed of tightly arranged filaments with a diameter of 1–2 μm under SEM (Fig. 7A).; SEM observation of elastin degradation by pseudoalterin.;  Pseudoalterin was added to bovine elastin at a ratio of 1:500 in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0) at 25 °C with continuous stirring for 20 min (B), 40 min (C), 60 min (D), and 80 min (E and F).; Based on SEM observations and the other results above, a model for the degradation mechanism of pseudoalterin on insoluble elastin is proposed (Fig. 8).;  When elastin is treated with pseudoalterin, the cross-links between these filaments are initially broken down and result in separating filaments and the release of cross-links in the form of DES-Ala-Ala and DES-Ala-Ala-Ala (Fig. 8B).;  Subsequently, these spherules, which are a coacervate of damaged elastin fragments, are digested into scattered molecules (Fig. 8E), which are further hydrolyzed into small peptides due to the attack by pseudoalterin on Gly-Xaa sites in the hydrophobic regions (Fig. 8F).; Schematic model for the elastin degradation mechanism of pseudoalterin.;  In this model, elastin is composed of filaments cross-linked by DES and IDE (A).;  Spherules comprising coacervated and partly degraded elastin are digested into scattered damaged elastin species around the same size as tropoelastin (E), which are further hydrolyzed to yield small peptides due to the continued attack by pseudoalterin on Gly-Xaa sites in the hydrophobic regions (F).;  Blue balls, coacervate spherules; orange balls, tropoelastin monomers; red broken lines indicate the potential cleavage sites of pseudoalterin in the cross-linking regions of elastin.;  However, in contrast to staphylolysin that slowly degrades insoluble elastin (18), pseudoalterin quickly degrades insoluble elastin.;  It is worth noting that pseudoalterin's activity on elastinorcein is much higher than that of pseudolysin, an elastase of family M4 from P. aeruginosa (48), and that of myroilysin, an elastase of family M12 from the deep-sea bacterium M. profundi D25 (13).; Light microscopic observations indicated that pseudoalterin swells elastin and separates elastin into filaments, implying that this enzyme initially break downs cross-links between the filaments.;  All reported M23 proteases show specificity for glycyl bonds (23, 28–32) and therefore only have the capacity to cleave in the hydrophobic regions in elastin.;  However, analysis of the cleavage sites of pseudoalterin on bovine elastin indicated that, in addition to glycyl bonds, the peptide bond Ala–Lys, which is found in elastin cross-linking domains, was also cleaved by pseudoalterin.;  Further analysis with six peptides synthesized according to the bovine tropoelastin sequence showed that pseudoalterin also cleaves the peptide bonds Ala–Ala and Lys–Ala, which are found in the hydrophilic elastin cross-linking domains.;  These results indicated that pseudoalterin cleaves not only glycyl bonds in the hydrophobic regions but also peptide bonds in elastin cross-linking domain in the hydrophilic regions during elastin degradation.; DES and IDE are the cross-linking molecules in the network of elastin.;  Detection in elastin hydrolysate of their peptic derivatives DES/IDE-A, DES/IDE-AA, DES/IDE-AAA, and DES/IDE-AAAA can provide direct evidence for the activity of pseudoalterin toward the peptide bonds on both sides of lysine residue in the hydrophilic domains.;  We aimed to detect DES or the peptic derivatives of DES in the elastin hydrolysate released by pseudoalterin by using LC-MS.;  This finding indicated that pseudoalterin cleaves peptide bonds in the hydrophilic regions of elastin to release cross-links.;  Moreover, as a model system with defined components, degradation of pseudoalterin of the chemical cross-links between recombinant tropoelastin spherules was directly observed under SEM, and it provided strong evidence for the same conclusion.;  Furthermore, SEM observation of the degradation process by pseudoalterin on bovine elastin showed that pseudoalterin successively released filaments, droplets, and spherules from elastic fibers by destroying the cross-links at each structural level.;  Based on the results of biochemical experiments and SEM observations, a detailed mechanism for elastin degradation by pseudoalterin is proposed (Fig. 8).;  In addition to the cleavage of glycyl bonds in elastin as other M23 proteases, pseudoalterin also cleaves the peptide bonds in elastin's hydrophilic regions that include cross-links, leading to an ensuing rapid degradation of elastin.;  As the bacterial proteases of M23 may be common in marine sediments, as analyzed above (supplemental Table S5), the high activity of pseudoalterin toward elastin indicates the important role of M23 proteases in the degradation of the marine sedimentary elastin.;  Our results on the elastolytic mechanism of pseudoalterin are helpful for clarifying the degradation mechanism of deep-sea sedimentary elastin.; It is worth reiterating that, as stated in the Introduction, specific steps in the assembly of tropoelastin in vivo remain unclear.;  The degradation of bovine elastin by pseudoalterin supplies a new path to help investigate this system from the opposite direction.;  Many researchers recognize 100–200-nm fibrillar intermediates in native and artificial elastin (51–54).;  At the late stage of cross-linked tropoelastin degradations that were seen here, particles were released that were similar to the size of the tropoelastin monomer.;  By using pseudoalterin to dissect components of the native elastic fiber, it could be speculated that tropoelastin monomers interconvert with ∼150-nm spherules by initial coacervation, then into 2–3-μm spheres accompanied by progressive cross-linking (3), and association with microfibrils where they are cross-linked into networked elastic fibers.",elastin,Ala-Ala,,up

 Ten milligrams of bovine elastin in 0.5 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0) containing 10 μg of pseudoalterin was incubated at 25 °C with continuous stirring.;  Bovine elastin in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0) without pseudoalterin served as the negative control.;  A, macroscopic observation of the hydrolysis of bovine elastin by pseudoalterin.;  B, light microscopic observation of hydrolysis of bovine elastin by pseudoalterin after 1 and 2 h.; To further analyze the elastolytic mechanism of pseudoalterin, its cleavage sites on bovine elastin were analyzed (supplemental Fig.;  Twenty seven peptides released from bovine elastin by pseudoalterin digestion were separated, and their molecular masses and sequences were identified.;  Based on the sequences of these peptides, 32 cleavage sites on bovine elastin were determined (supplemental Table S3).;  Furthermore, a cleavage site Ala↓ Lys in the hydrophilic domain involved in cross-linking in elastin was also detected, which has not been reported for any other M23 protease.; To confirm the cleavage sites analyzed above, based on the sequence of bovine tropoelastin in the database (SwissProt accession number P04985-1), four peptides (GVGVAP, IGGGAGG, GIGLGP, and PGAGARF) in the hydrophobic regions and two typical peptides (AAAKAA and AAAAAKAAAK) in the hydrophilic regions were synthesized to assess their efficacy as potential substrates for pseudoalterin.;  This result confirmed the cleavage sites analyzed above and indicated that pseudoalterin can cleave the peptide bonds Ala-Ala and Lys-Ala in the hydrophilic regions in elastin.; DES is a cross-link that is characteristic of elastin (8).;  If pseudoalterin can break down the cross-links in elastin by cleaving the peptide bonds Ala–Ala, Ala–Lys, and/or Lys–Ala in the hydrophilic regions, then DES and/or peptic derivatives of DES with one or more alanine residues, such as DES-Ala, DES-Ala-Ala, DES-Ala-Ala-Ala, or DES-Ala-Ala-Ala-Ala, would be released in the elastin hydrolysate.;  To test this hypothesis, elastin hydrolysates were analyzed by LC-MS.;  Because the long peptides in the elastin hydrolysate were removed before LC-MS analysis, a subset of compounds was detected in the mass spectrum of the elastin hydrolysate.;  Among these peaks, two abundant ions were m/z 669.5 and m/z 740.5, representing the masses of DES-Ala-Ala and DES-Ala-Ala-Ala, respectively (Fig. 4B), indicating that DES-Ala-Ala and DES-Ala-Ala-Ala were released from bovine elastin by pseudoalterin.; LC-MS analysis of peptic derivatives of DES in the elastin hydrolysate released by pseudoalterin.
A, mass spectrum of DES standard.;  B, mass spectrum of elastin hydrolysate.;  Twenty milligrams of bovine elastin was degraded by 20 μg of pseudoalterin at 25 °C for 36 h followed by addition of 500 μl of 4% sulfosalicylic acid to remove the long peptides.; On this basis, the cleavage sites of pseudoalterin on bovine tropoelastin are shown in Fig. 5.;  These cleavage sites indicate that pseudoalterin can cleave the peptide bonds both in the hydrophilic regions and in the hydrophobic regions to effectively degrade insoluble elastin.; Cleavage sites by pseudoalterin on bovine tropoelastin (SwissProt accession number P04985-1).;  Cleavage sites were determined by analysis of the sequences of peptides released by pseudoalterin from bovine elastin as shown in supplemental Table S3, and the cleavage sites of pseudoalterin on six peptides were synthesized according to the sequence of bovine tropoelastin as shown in Fig. 3.; To model the degradation of elastin by pseudoalterin, human tropoelastin was expressed and purified and then chemically cross-linked in vitro.;  After cross-linking, the tropoelastin spherules were linked into clusters or filaments like beads on a string under SEM (Fig. 6A).;  When the cross-linked tropoelastin spherules were incubated with pseudoalterin for 10 min, physical contacts between the spherules dissipated or fractured (Fig. 6B).;  After 15 min of incubation, most clusters separated into single spherules (Fig. 6C), and some spherules began to reveal ∼15 nm substructures, i.e. the size of tropoelastin monomers (Fig. 6D).;  These observations revealed that pseudoalterin was capable of proteolytically attacking a synthetic elastin model where no other substrate was present other than that which contained target elastolytic sequences, regardless of the fact that it was cross-linked.; Degradation of recombinant tropoelastin cross-linking clusters by pseudoalterin.
A, 10 mg/ml tropoelastin following incubation with 10 mm BS3 in 10 mm PBS for 30 min.; To further understand the degradation mechanism of pseudoalterin on elastin, the process was observed by SEM.;  Bovine elastin is composed of tightly arranged filaments with a diameter of 1–2 μm under SEM (Fig. 7A).; SEM observation of elastin degradation by pseudoalterin.;  Pseudoalterin was added to bovine elastin at a ratio of 1:500 in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0) at 25 °C with continuous stirring for 20 min (B), 40 min (C), 60 min (D), and 80 min (E and F).; Based on SEM observations and the other results above, a model for the degradation mechanism of pseudoalterin on insoluble elastin is proposed (Fig. 8).;  When elastin is treated with pseudoalterin, the cross-links between these filaments are initially broken down and result in separating filaments and the release of cross-links in the form of DES-Ala-Ala and DES-Ala-Ala-Ala (Fig. 8B).;  Subsequently, these spherules, which are a coacervate of damaged elastin fragments, are digested into scattered molecules (Fig. 8E), which are further hydrolyzed into small peptides due to the attack by pseudoalterin on Gly-Xaa sites in the hydrophobic regions (Fig. 8F).; Schematic model for the elastin degradation mechanism of pseudoalterin.;  In this model, elastin is composed of filaments cross-linked by DES and IDE (A).;  Spherules comprising coacervated and partly degraded elastin are digested into scattered damaged elastin species around the same size as tropoelastin (E), which are further hydrolyzed to yield small peptides due to the continued attack by pseudoalterin on Gly-Xaa sites in the hydrophobic regions (F).;  Blue balls, coacervate spherules; orange balls, tropoelastin monomers; red broken lines indicate the potential cleavage sites of pseudoalterin in the cross-linking regions of elastin.;  However, in contrast to staphylolysin that slowly degrades insoluble elastin (18), pseudoalterin quickly degrades insoluble elastin.;  It is worth noting that pseudoalterin's activity on elastinorcein is much higher than that of pseudolysin, an elastase of family M4 from P. aeruginosa (48), and that of myroilysin, an elastase of family M12 from the deep-sea bacterium M. profundi D25 (13).; Light microscopic observations indicated that pseudoalterin swells elastin and separates elastin into filaments, implying that this enzyme initially break downs cross-links between the filaments.;  All reported M23 proteases show specificity for glycyl bonds (23, 28–32) and therefore only have the capacity to cleave in the hydrophobic regions in elastin.;  However, analysis of the cleavage sites of pseudoalterin on bovine elastin indicated that, in addition to glycyl bonds, the peptide bond Ala–Lys, which is found in elastin cross-linking domains, was also cleaved by pseudoalterin.;  Further analysis with six peptides synthesized according to the bovine tropoelastin sequence showed that pseudoalterin also cleaves the peptide bonds Ala–Ala and Lys–Ala, which are found in the hydrophilic elastin cross-linking domains.;  These results indicated that pseudoalterin cleaves not only glycyl bonds in the hydrophobic regions but also peptide bonds in elastin cross-linking domain in the hydrophilic regions during elastin degradation.; DES and IDE are the cross-linking molecules in the network of elastin.;  Detection in elastin hydrolysate of their peptic derivatives DES/IDE-A, DES/IDE-AA, DES/IDE-AAA, and DES/IDE-AAAA can provide direct evidence for the activity of pseudoalterin toward the peptide bonds on both sides of lysine residue in the hydrophilic domains.;  We aimed to detect DES or the peptic derivatives of DES in the elastin hydrolysate released by pseudoalterin by using LC-MS.;  This finding indicated that pseudoalterin cleaves peptide bonds in the hydrophilic regions of elastin to release cross-links.;  Moreover, as a model system with defined components, degradation of pseudoalterin of the chemical cross-links between recombinant tropoelastin spherules was directly observed under SEM, and it provided strong evidence for the same conclusion.;  Furthermore, SEM observation of the degradation process by pseudoalterin on bovine elastin showed that pseudoalterin successively released filaments, droplets, and spherules from elastic fibers by destroying the cross-links at each structural level.;  Based on the results of biochemical experiments and SEM observations, a detailed mechanism for elastin degradation by pseudoalterin is proposed (Fig. 8).;  In addition to the cleavage of glycyl bonds in elastin as other M23 proteases, pseudoalterin also cleaves the peptide bonds in elastin's hydrophilic regions that include cross-links, leading to an ensuing rapid degradation of elastin.;  As the bacterial proteases of M23 may be common in marine sediments, as analyzed above (supplemental Table S5), the high activity of pseudoalterin toward elastin indicates the important role of M23 proteases in the degradation of the marine sedimentary elastin.;  Our results on the elastolytic mechanism of pseudoalterin are helpful for clarifying the degradation mechanism of deep-sea sedimentary elastin.; It is worth reiterating that, as stated in the Introduction, specific steps in the assembly of tropoelastin in vivo remain unclear.;  The degradation of bovine elastin by pseudoalterin supplies a new path to help investigate this system from the opposite direction.;  Many researchers recognize 100–200-nm fibrillar intermediates in native and artificial elastin (51–54).;  At the late stage of cross-linked tropoelastin degradations that were seen here, particles were released that were similar to the size of the tropoelastin monomer.;  By using pseudoalterin to dissect components of the native elastic fiber, it could be speculated that tropoelastin monomers interconvert with ∼150-nm spherules by initial coacervation, then into 2–3-μm spheres accompanied by progressive cross-linking (3), and association with microfibrils where they are cross-linked into networked elastic fibers.",elastin,desmosine,,up
23012370,3501066,"Background: The mechanism of marine elastin degradation is unclear.; Results: A novel M23 metalloprotease pseudoalterin from a marine bacterium degraded elastin by cleaving both the glycyl bonds and the peptide bonds involved in cross-linking.; Significance: The results shed light on the mechanism of marine elastin degradation.;  It is still unclear how marine elastin is degraded because of the limited study of marine elastases.;  Pseudoalterin has a narrow specificity but high activity toward elastin.;  Analysis of the cleavage sites of pseudoalterin on elastin showed that pseudoalterin cleaves the glycyl bonds in hydrophobic regions and the peptide bonds Ala–Ala, Ala–Lys, and Lys–Ala involved in cross-linking.;  Two peptic derivatives of desmosine, desmosine-Ala-Ala and desmosine-Ala-Ala-Ala, were detected in the elastin hydrolysate, indicating that pseudoalterin can dissociate cross-linked elastin.;  These results reveal a new elastolytic mechanism of the M23 protease pseudoalterin, which is different from the reported mechanism where the M23 proteases only cleave glycyl bonds in elastin.;  Genome analysis suggests that M23 proteases may be popular in deep-sea sediments, implying their important role in elastin degradation.;  An elastin degradation model of pseudoalterin was proposed, based on these results and scanning electron microscopic analysis of the degradation by pseudoalterin of bovine elastin and cross-linked recombinant tropoelastin.;  Our results shed light on the mechanism of elastin degradation in deep-sea sediment.;  On this basis, elastin represents an important component of marine organic nitrogen, and its degradation cannot be ignored for marine nitrogen recycling.; The formation of elastin is classically characterized by four stages as follows: tropoelastin synthesis and secretion, association through coacervation, deposition on microfibrils, and cross-linking (2).;  Tropoelastin is the precursor of elastin whose sequence contains two major types of domains, hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions.;  Secreted tropoelastin molecules are ∼15-nm asymmetric monomers that aggregate on the cell surface to form spherules through coacervation by hydrophobic interactions (3–6).;  In vitro observation of coacervated recombinant tropoelastin has demonstrated that this association is a noncovalent process that can by reversed by simple changes in environmental conditions such as temperature and salt (7).;  Lysine residues on the massed tropoelastin spherules are oxidized and polymerized to bi-, tri-, and tetrafunctional cross-links, including desmosine (DES)2 and isodesmosine (IDE), to form native elastin networks with the participation of lysyl oxidase (8).;  Various sizes of tropoelastin aggregates before being cross-linked have been identified in vitro, ranging from ∼200 nm to 2–6 μm (2, 5, 9, 10).;  However, the precise details of elastin assembly in vivo are still unclear.; Human tropoelastin is translated from a single gene and spliced to multiple isoforms.;  Exon 26A is a unique domain in human elastin that is usually spliced out in healthy elastic tissue and is occasionally retained under damaged elastin conditions (11).;  Tropoelastin SHELdelta26A corresponding to amino acid residues 27–724 of GenBankTM entry {""type"":""entrez-protein"",""attrs"":{""text"":""AAC98394"",""term_id"":""182020""}}AAC98394 (gi182020) is an isoform of synthetic human elastin without domain 26A.;  Tropoelastin SHELdelta26A can reversibly associate by coacervation at suitable temperature, concentration, NaCl concentration, and pH (12).;  Additionally, chemical cross-linker bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (BS3) has been used to cross-link the SHELdelta26A tropoelastin to study the structural features of tropoelastin monomer (10).; Because of their insoluble and highly cross-linked nature, elastin is resistant to most proteases, except for a limited number of elastases.;  For this reason, the mechanism of marine elastin degradation remains unclear.;  For this reason, elastin is recognized as a preferred substrate for the M23 proteases because there are ∼33% glycine residues in the tropoelastin sequence (33).;  Moreover, the elastolytic mechanism of pseudoalterin was studied in detail by biochemical experiments and through SEM observations, thus revealing that pseudoalterin digests elastin effectively by a mechanism that is distinct from the reported M23 proteases.;  The results help to clarify the degradation mechanism of deep-sea sedimentary elastin.;  Insoluble type I collagen fiber (bovine achilles tendon) was purchased from Worthington. α-casein, gamma globulin, elastinorcein, BS3, and bovine neck ligament elastin isoform 1 (SwissProt accession number {""type"":""entrez-protein"",""attrs"":{""text"":""P04985"",""term_id"":""119293""}}P04985–1) (hereafter called bovine elastin) were purchased from Sigma, and gelatin was from Boston Biomedical Inc.;  CF6-2 was cultured at 15 °C for 48 h in the fermentation medium containing 0.2% (w/w) yeast extract, 0.3% (w/w) bovine elastin, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm Na2HPO4, and artificial seawater (pH 8.0).;  One unit of elastinolytic activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that increased 0.01 unit of absorbance at 590 nm/min.; Bovine elastin (10 mg) was incubated with pseudoalterin (10 μg) in 0.5 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0) at 25 °C with continuous stirring.;  Bovine elastin in the same buffer without pseudoalterin served as negative controls.; Soluble products from pseudoalterin digestion of 10 mg of elastin were boiled for 10 min to terminate the reaction and loaded onto LC-MS to analyze the molecular masses of the released peptides.; Twenty milligrams of bovine elastin was mixed with 20 μg of pseudoalterin in 500 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0).;  The same treatment with BSA instead of bovine elastin served as controls.; Recombinant human tropoelastin isoform SHELdelta26A was purified as described previously (12, 45).;  Tropoelastin was dissolved to 10 mg/ml in 10 mm phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4).;  The cross-linked tropoelastin was washed with the PBS repeatedly, followed by hydrolysis with 0.1 mg/ml pseudoalterin for 10 and 15 min at 25 °C.; Five milligrams of bovine elastin was mixed with 10 μg of pseudoalterin in 200 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), and the mixture was incubated at 25 °C with continuous stirring for different times.;  The specific activity of pseudoalterin toward elastinorcein at 25 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0) was quite high.;  The activity of pseudoalterin toward elastinorcein was detectable over a broad range from pH 7 to 11 with a maximal activity at pH 9.5, whereas the optimal temperature of pseudoalterin was 25 °C (supplemental Fig.;  Pseudoalterin appeared to require zinc ion for its hydrolytic activity as 1 mm 1,10-phenanthroline completely abolished its activity against elastinorcein.;  The half-life was the time that it took to eliminate 50% of the activity of pseudoalterin with elastinorcein at a given temperature.; b The optimum pH was determined by measuring the activities of pseudoalterin with elastinorcein (30 °C) in Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4 buffer at pH values ranging from 6.5 to 8, barbital sodium/HCl buffer at pH values ranging from 7.5 to 9.6, and NaHCO3/NaOH buffer ranging from 9.6 to 11.0.; c The optimum temperature was determined by measuring the activities of pseudoalterin with elastinorcein in 50 mm Tris buffer (pH 9.0) or in artificial sea water at temperatures ranging from 0 to 45 °C.; a Elastolytic activity of pseudoalterin was measured at 25 °C for elastinorcein.; b Pseudoalterin was incubated with each inhibitor at 25 °C for 20 min, and then the enzyme activity was measured at 25 °C for elastinorcein.;  Pseudoalterin had very high activity toward elastinorcein (528 units/mg), much higher than pseudolysin and myroilysin.;  Except for elastin, pseudoalterin showed little hydrolysis of any other proteins that were tested, including casein, type I collagen fibers, fibrin, and gamma-globulin (Table 3 and supplemental Fig.; Fig. 2 revealed that pseudoalterin displayed high hydrolytic activity toward bovine elastin.;  When incubated at 25 °C, 10 mg of bovine elastin was visually degraded by 10 μg of pseudoalterin within 4 h (Fig. 2A).;  After treatment for 1 h, the elastin swelled, and numerous filaments were released, and these filaments were further degraded into smaller segments with further treatment time (Fig. 2B).; Hydrolysis of bovine elastin by pseudoalterin.;  Ten milligrams of bovine elastin in 0.5 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0) containing 10 μg of pseudoalterin was incubated at 25 °C with continuous stirring.;  Bovine elastin in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0) without pseudoalterin served as the negative control.;  A, macroscopic observation of the hydrolysis of bovine elastin by pseudoalterin.;  B, light microscopic observation of hydrolysis of bovine elastin by pseudoalterin after 1 and 2 h.; To further analyze the elastolytic mechanism of pseudoalterin, its cleavage sites on bovine elastin were analyzed (supplemental Fig.;  Twenty seven peptides released from bovine elastin by pseudoalterin digestion were separated, and their molecular masses and sequences were identified.;  Based on the sequences of these peptides, 32 cleavage sites on bovine elastin were determined (supplemental Table S3).;  Furthermore, a cleavage site Ala↓ Lys in the hydrophilic domain involved in cross-linking in elastin was also detected, which has not been reported for any other M23 protease.; To confirm the cleavage sites analyzed above, based on the sequence of bovine tropoelastin in the database (SwissProt accession number P04985-1), four peptides (GVGVAP, IGGGAGG, GIGLGP, and PGAGARF) in the hydrophobic regions and two typical peptides (AAAKAA and AAAAAKAAAK) in the hydrophilic regions were synthesized to assess their efficacy as potential substrates for pseudoalterin.;  This result confirmed the cleavage sites analyzed above and indicated that pseudoalterin can cleave the peptide bonds Ala-Ala and Lys-Ala in the hydrophilic regions in elastin.; DES is a cross-link that is characteristic of elastin (8).;  If pseudoalterin can break down the cross-links in elastin by cleaving the peptide bonds Ala–Ala, Ala–Lys, and/or Lys–Ala in the hydrophilic regions, then DES and/or peptic derivatives of DES with one or more alanine residues, such as DES-Ala, DES-Ala-Ala, DES-Ala-Ala-Ala, or DES-Ala-Ala-Ala-Ala, would be released in the elastin hydrolysate.;  To test this hypothesis, elastin hydrolysates were analyzed by LC-MS.;  Because the long peptides in the elastin hydrolysate were removed before LC-MS analysis, a subset of compounds was detected in the mass spectrum of the elastin hydrolysate.;  Among these peaks, two abundant ions were m/z 669.5 and m/z 740.5, representing the masses of DES-Ala-Ala and DES-Ala-Ala-Ala, respectively (Fig. 4B), indicating that DES-Ala-Ala and DES-Ala-Ala-Ala were released from bovine elastin by pseudoalterin.; LC-MS analysis of peptic derivatives of DES in the elastin hydrolysate released by pseudoalterin.
A, mass spectrum of DES standard.;  B, mass spectrum of elastin hydrolysate.;  Twenty milligrams of bovine elastin was degraded by 20 μg of pseudoalterin at 25 °C for 36 h followed by addition of 500 μl of 4% sulfosalicylic acid to remove the long peptides.; On this basis, the cleavage sites of pseudoalterin on bovine tropoelastin are shown in Fig. 5.;  These cleavage sites indicate that pseudoalterin can cleave the peptide bonds both in the hydrophilic regions and in the hydrophobic regions to effectively degrade insoluble elastin.; Cleavage sites by pseudoalterin on bovine tropoelastin (SwissProt accession number P04985-1).;  Cleavage sites were determined by analysis of the sequences of peptides released by pseudoalterin from bovine elastin as shown in supplemental Table S3, and the cleavage sites of pseudoalterin on six peptides were synthesized according to the sequence of bovine tropoelastin as shown in Fig. 3.; To model the degradation of elastin by pseudoalterin, human tropoelastin was expressed and purified and then chemically cross-linked in vitro.;  After cross-linking, the tropoelastin spherules were linked into clusters or filaments like beads on a string under SEM (Fig. 6A).;  When the cross-linked tropoelastin spherules were incubated with pseudoalterin for 10 min, physical contacts between the spherules dissipated or fractured (Fig. 6B).;  After 15 min of incubation, most clusters separated into single spherules (Fig. 6C), and some spherules began to reveal ∼15 nm substructures, i.e. the size of tropoelastin monomers (Fig. 6D).;  These observations revealed that pseudoalterin was capable of proteolytically attacking a synthetic elastin model where no other substrate was present other than that which contained target elastolytic sequences, regardless of the fact that it was cross-linked.; Degradation of recombinant tropoelastin cross-linking clusters by pseudoalterin.
A, 10 mg/ml tropoelastin following incubation with 10 mm BS3 in 10 mm PBS for 30 min.; To further understand the degradation mechanism of pseudoalterin on elastin, the process was observed by SEM.;  Bovine elastin is composed of tightly arranged filaments with a diameter of 1–2 μm under SEM (Fig. 7A).; SEM observation of elastin degradation by pseudoalterin.;  Pseudoalterin was added to bovine elastin at a ratio of 1:500 in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0) at 25 °C with continuous stirring for 20 min (B), 40 min (C), 60 min (D), and 80 min (E and F).; Based on SEM observations and the other results above, a model for the degradation mechanism of pseudoalterin on insoluble elastin is proposed (Fig. 8).;  When elastin is treated with pseudoalterin, the cross-links between these filaments are initially broken down and result in separating filaments and the release of cross-links in the form of DES-Ala-Ala and DES-Ala-Ala-Ala (Fig. 8B).;  Subsequently, these spherules, which are a coacervate of damaged elastin fragments, are digested into scattered molecules (Fig. 8E), which are further hydrolyzed into small peptides due to the attack by pseudoalterin on Gly-Xaa sites in the hydrophobic regions (Fig. 8F).; Schematic model for the elastin degradation mechanism of pseudoalterin.;  In this model, elastin is composed of filaments cross-linked by DES and IDE (A).;  Spherules comprising coacervated and partly degraded elastin are digested into scattered damaged elastin species around the same size as tropoelastin (E), which are further hydrolyzed to yield small peptides due to the continued attack by pseudoalterin on Gly-Xaa sites in the hydrophobic regions (F).;  Blue balls, coacervate spherules; orange balls, tropoelastin monomers; red broken lines indicate the potential cleavage sites of pseudoalterin in the cross-linking regions of elastin.;  However, in contrast to staphylolysin that slowly degrades insoluble elastin (18), pseudoalterin quickly degrades insoluble elastin.;  It is worth noting that pseudoalterin's activity on elastinorcein is much higher than that of pseudolysin, an elastase of family M4 from P. aeruginosa (48), and that of myroilysin, an elastase of family M12 from the deep-sea bacterium M. profundi D25 (13).; Light microscopic observations indicated that pseudoalterin swells elastin and separates elastin into filaments, implying that this enzyme initially break downs cross-links between the filaments.;  All reported M23 proteases show specificity for glycyl bonds (23, 28–32) and therefore only have the capacity to cleave in the hydrophobic regions in elastin.;  However, analysis of the cleavage sites of pseudoalterin on bovine elastin indicated that, in addition to glycyl bonds, the peptide bond Ala–Lys, which is found in elastin cross-linking domains, was also cleaved by pseudoalterin.;  Further analysis with six peptides synthesized according to the bovine tropoelastin sequence showed that pseudoalterin also cleaves the peptide bonds Ala–Ala and Lys–Ala, which are found in the hydrophilic elastin cross-linking domains.;  These results indicated that pseudoalterin cleaves not only glycyl bonds in the hydrophobic regions but also peptide bonds in elastin cross-linking domain in the hydrophilic regions during elastin degradation.; DES and IDE are the cross-linking molecules in the network of elastin.;  Detection in elastin hydrolysate of their peptic derivatives DES/IDE-A, DES/IDE-AA, DES/IDE-AAA, and DES/IDE-AAAA can provide direct evidence for the activity of pseudoalterin toward the peptide bonds on both sides of lysine residue in the hydrophilic domains.;  We aimed to detect DES or the peptic derivatives of DES in the elastin hydrolysate released by pseudoalterin by using LC-MS.;  This finding indicated that pseudoalterin cleaves peptide bonds in the hydrophilic regions of elastin to release cross-links.;  Moreover, as a model system with defined components, degradation of pseudoalterin of the chemical cross-links between recombinant tropoelastin spherules was directly observed under SEM, and it provided strong evidence for the same conclusion.;  Furthermore, SEM observation of the degradation process by pseudoalterin on bovine elastin showed that pseudoalterin successively released filaments, droplets, and spherules from elastic fibers by destroying the cross-links at each structural level.;  Based on the results of biochemical experiments and SEM observations, a detailed mechanism for elastin degradation by pseudoalterin is proposed (Fig. 8).;  In addition to the cleavage of glycyl bonds in elastin as other M23 proteases, pseudoalterin also cleaves the peptide bonds in elastin's hydrophilic regions that include cross-links, leading to an ensuing rapid degradation of elastin.;  As the bacterial proteases of M23 may be common in marine sediments, as analyzed above (supplemental Table S5), the high activity of pseudoalterin toward elastin indicates the important role of M23 proteases in the degradation of the marine sedimentary elastin.;  Our results on the elastolytic mechanism of pseudoalterin are helpful for clarifying the degradation mechanism of deep-sea sedimentary elastin.; It is worth reiterating that, as stated in the Introduction, specific steps in the assembly of tropoelastin in vivo remain unclear.;

Numerous living organisms have been discovered in these hostile environments including microorganisms (Eubacteria and Archaea) and pluricellular organisms such as shrimps, clams and giant mussels, giant tubeworms, crabs and fishes [18]. These organisms have developed different strategies to ensure their adaptation to these extreme environments.;  Some microorganisms thrive at the low temperature of 1–4 °C prevailing in the deep sea (cold-adapted psychrophilic bacteria), others, mesophiles, at moderate temperatures (10–60 °C) and finally, some strains, called thermophiles or hyperthermophiles, thrive at around 60 °C and 100 °C, respectively [17]. For example, the archaea Pyrolobus fumarii can grow at 113 °C with an optimal temperature of growth at 106 °C [19]. In contrast to photosynthetic organisms that use solar energy, carbon dioxide, nutrients and water to produce organic materials and thereby biomass, chemiolithoautotrophic bacteria in deep sea hydrothermal vents are able to extract chemical energy starting from the oxidation of reduced mineral compounds present in their habitat.;  This aspect of carbon fixation has been mentioned in some excellent reviews [20–24]. In this review, we summarize current knowledge about enzymes that are involved in carbon dioxide fixation and assimilation, such as carbonic anhydrase, by organisms associated with deep sea hydrothermal vents.; Based on numerous reports, organisms of deep sea hydrothermal vents use several metabolic pathways for CO2 fixation.;  In addition, organisms of deep sea vents possess different forms of carbonic anhydrase important for assimilation of CO2 [30–34].; In addition to the Riftia pachyptila symbiont, other deep-sea invertebrate symbionts that utilize the Calvin cycle for CO2 fixation have since been characterized [12,36–40].; RuBisCO form I has been classified into four types, IA–ID, based on the amino acid homology of the large subunit genes (cbbL) [55]. Previous studies showed that the bacterial forms IA/IC and II occur in deep sea hydrothermal vents.;  Form IA is present in Proteobacteria [44,56,57] and in the symbionts of several deep-sea hydrothermal vents such as mollusks and some Pogonophora species [58–61]. Form IB has only been identified from a vent plume at a Mid-Okinawa trough hydrothermal vent.;  Form II has been identified in free-living autotrophic microbial communities at only two hydrothermal vent sites [44,57]. In addition, form II was detected as the predominant form in cold seeps, symbionts of tubeworms and some deep-sea clams [62,63]. The crystal structure and biochemical studies of RuBisCO (Tk-Rubisco) from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Thermococcus kodakaraensis KOD1 indicated that its structure is distinct from form I and II RuBisCO [64]. This Tk-Rubisco is classified as a novel form III.; Pioneer work on the presence of the rTCA cycle in deep-sea hydrothermal vent microbial communities has been obtained from expression studies of the episymbiotic community associated with the vent polychaete Alvinella pompejana [57,66,67]. This deep-sea polychaete Alvinella pompejana colonizes tubes on the sides of black smoker chimneys along the East Pacific Rise.;  The two key genes in the rTCA cycle, the ATP citrate lyase and 2-oxoglutarate: ferredoxin oxidoreductase, were utilized to demonstrate the abundance of these genes in the episymbiont community [66] and in diverse vent samples [57]. The overall results of these analyses demonstrated: (i) the presence and expression of key rTCA cycle genes in at least two groups of free-living microorganisms from deep-sea hydrothermal vents; and (ii) the majority of autotrophs that utilize the reverse tricarboxylic acid cycle are members of the epsilon subdivision of Proteobacteria.;  Concerning the best studied organism in deep sea hydrothermal vents, the giant tubeworm Riftia pachyptila, its chemoautotrophic gamma proteobacterial endosymbionts fix carbon via the Calvin cycle [12,13,16,17,35]. In addition, recent proteomic analyses revealed the presence of enzymes involved in the reverse TCA cycle [68]. These results indicated that Riftia uses both the reverse TCA pathway and the Calvin cycle for fixation of CO2.; Several studies of the occurrence of the rTCA cycle in microbial communities of deep-sea hydrothermal habitats have been carried out.;  These studies demonstrated that pure cultures of Epsilonproteobacteria and Aquificae, which include representatives of hydrothermal vent bacteria, fix carbon dioxide via the rTCA cycle [69–76]. Comparative analyses of the ATP citrate lyase encoding genes from natural microbial communities of three deep-sea hydrothermal vent systems located on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR; Rainbow, Logatchev and Broken Spur) suggested that Epsilonproteobacteria were the dominant primary producers using the reverse TCA cycle (rTCA) at Rainbow, while Aquificales of the genera Desulfurobacterium and Persephonella were prevalent in the Broken Spur chimney [76]. Several studies indicate that the majority of bacteria associated with deep-sea hydrothermal chimneys are members of the Epsilonproteobacteria [73,77–81]. The habitat of these bacteria are located in the zone where hydrothermal fluids mix with ambient seawater giving temperatures in the range from 20 to 60 °C and characterized by microaerobic to anaerobic conditions [71]. Since the energy in these environments is limited, it is more favorable to use a carbon fixation pathway other than the Calvin cycle, which requires nine ATP molecules to synthesize one triose phosphate molecule compared to five ATP for the reductive TCA cycle [82]. The fact that the Epsilonproteobacteria at hydrothermal vent sites express enzymes of rTCA, suggests that the rTCA cycle could play a more important role in chemoautotrophic production by free-living microorganisms at hydrothermal vents than the Calvin cycle.;  The 3-hydroxypropionate bicycle appears to be restricted to Chloroflexaceae [24,83–85]. Consequently, this cycle may not be present in deep sea vents.; At deep-sea hydrothermal vents, the majority of methanogenic microorganisms use the reductive acetyl-CoA pathway for carbon fixation.;  The key enzyme of the DC/4-HB cycle is 4-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydratase [94,95]. This pathway occurs in the thermophilic crenarchaeon Ignicoccus hospitalis (Desulfurococcales), but it is also present in other Crenarchaeota such as Thermoproteales and Desulfurococcales [23,93,96]. I. hospitalis is a chemolithoautotrophic, sulfur reducer and hyperthermophilic crenarchaeon which was isolated from a submarine hydrothermal system at the Kolbeinsey Ridge, to the north of Iceland [97]. Microbial analyses at several deep sea hydrothermal vent sites showed the abundance of archaeal domains Crenarchaeota, including the group closely associated with Ignicoccus [98–100]. This evidence suggests that the fixation of CO2 might occur through dicarboxylate/4-hydroxybutyrate cycle at deep sea hydrothermal vents.;  The key enzyme of the 3-HP/4-HB cycle, 4-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydratase, was identified in the genome of marine group 1 Crenarchaeota [104] and in the Global Ocean Sampling database [101,105,106]. A recent study showed that anaerobic ammonium-oxidizing bacteria and archaea are present and active in hydrothermal vent areas [107]. Therefore, it appears that the 3-HP/4-hydroxybutyrate is potentially an important carbon fixation pathway in deep-sea hydrothermal vents.; In prokaryotes there are three phylogenetically distinct classes of CAs: α, β and γ. Interestingly all three of these classes of CA are present in the Thiomicrospira crunogena, a deep-sea hydrothermal vent sulfur-oxidizing chemolithoautotroph that lives in a spatially and thermally heterogeneous environment [33,116]. When the corresponding genes have been expressed in Escherichia coli, CA activity was detected for α-CA and β-CA, but not for the γ-CA-like protein [33].; Organisms that live in the environment of deep sea hydrothermal vents characterized by extreme physico-chemical conditions of temperature, pressure, pH and high concentrations of toxic heavy metals represent one of the most important sources for the development of new biotechnological applications.;  Concerning carbon dioxide fixation and assimilation, the environment of deep sea hydrothermal vents can provide sources of unique enzymes, genes and metabolic processes important for the development of technologies related to industrial processes for reduction of atmospheric CO2, biofuels production, materials and chemical synthesis [17,119–122].;  Several studies have showed that CO2 may be converted to ethanol by Rhodobacter species under anoxygenic conditions in the light or under dark aerobic growth conditions [132–134]. Therefore, microbes from hydrothermal deep sea vents that can fix CO2 into biomass could be of interest for development of the technologies for the production of biofuel as well as other compounds.;  The majority of enzymes exhibit very low, or no, activity when the temperature exceeds 50 °C [134]. Most industrial processes to eliminate CO2 occur at elevated temperatures, and immobilization techniques to retain biocatalyst activity will need to be performed at relatively higher temperatures [142]. In the environments of deep sea hydrothermal vents, many microorganisms have adapted to high temperatures, toxic substances such as H2S and heavy metals.; Deep sea hydrothermal vents are isolated habitats that contain many unique organisms of the three domains of life; archaea, bacteria and eukarya.;  Four different forms of RuBisCO, designated as I, II, III and IV, operate in different microbial communities associated with deep sea hydrothermal vents.;  It appears that the 3-HP/4-hydroxybutyrate is potentially an important carbon fixation pathway for archaeal communities in deep-sea hydrothermal vent environments.; In order to develop and improve new technologies, it is important to search and explore enzymes from different sources.;  The organisms of deep sea hydrothermal vents are well adapted to fix carbon dioxide in an unusual range of temperatures, pressure condition, pH and metal toxicity.",sea,CO2,,up

This evidence suggests that the fixation of CO2 might occur through dicarboxylate/4-hydroxybutyrate cycle at deep sea hydrothermal vents.;  The key enzyme of the 3-HP/4-HB cycle, 4-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydratase, was identified in the genome of marine group 1 Crenarchaeota [104] and in the Global Ocean Sampling database [101,105,106]. A recent study showed that anaerobic ammonium-oxidizing bacteria and archaea are present and active in hydrothermal vent areas [107]. Therefore, it appears that the 3-HP/4-hydroxybutyrate is potentially an important carbon fixation pathway in deep-sea hydrothermal vents.; In prokaryotes there are three phylogenetically distinct classes of CAs: α, β and γ. Interestingly all three of these classes of CA are present in the Thiomicrospira crunogena, a deep-sea hydrothermal vent sulfur-oxidizing chemolithoautotroph that lives in a spatially and thermally heterogeneous environment [33,116]. When the corresponding genes have been expressed in Escherichia coli, CA activity was detected for α-CA and β-CA, but not for the γ-CA-like protein [33].; Organisms that live in the environment of deep sea hydrothermal vents characterized by extreme physico-chemical conditions of temperature, pressure, pH and high concentrations of toxic heavy metals represent one of the most important sources for the development of new biotechnological applications.;  Concerning carbon dioxide fixation and assimilation, the environment of deep sea hydrothermal vents can provide sources of unique enzymes, genes and metabolic processes important for the development of technologies related to industrial processes for reduction of atmospheric CO2, biofuels production, materials and chemical synthesis [17,119–122].;  Several studies have showed that CO2 may be converted to ethanol by Rhodobacter species under anoxygenic conditions in the light or under dark aerobic growth conditions [132–134]. Therefore, microbes from hydrothermal deep sea vents that can fix CO2 into biomass could be of interest for development of the technologies for the production of biofuel as well as other compounds.;  The majority of enzymes exhibit very low, or no, activity when the temperature exceeds 50 °C [134]. Most industrial processes to eliminate CO2 occur at elevated temperatures, and immobilization techniques to retain biocatalyst activity will need to be performed at relatively higher temperatures [142]. In the environments of deep sea hydrothermal vents, many microorganisms have adapted to high temperatures, toxic substances such as H2S and heavy metals.; Deep sea hydrothermal vents are isolated habitats that contain many unique organisms of the three domains of life; archaea, bacteria and eukarya.;  Four different forms of RuBisCO, designated as I, II, III and IV, operate in different microbial communities associated with deep sea hydrothermal vents.;  It appears that the 3-HP/4-hydroxybutyrate is potentially an important carbon fixation pathway for archaeal communities in deep-sea hydrothermal vent environments.; In order to develop and improve new technologies, it is important to search and explore enzymes from different sources.;  The organisms of deep sea hydrothermal vents are well adapted to fix carbon dioxide in an unusual range of temperatures, pressure condition, pH and metal toxicity.",sea,water,,up

(2004) identified a putative ammonia monooxygenase (amoA)-like gene in an apparent archaeon-derived scaffold, and thus suggested ammonia (NH3) oxidation to be attributed to crenarchaea.;  Studies performed in deep North Atlantic and Eastern Mediterranean Sea revealed that archaeal amoA gene abundance was rather low even though 16S rRNA genes of MGI of Crenarchaeota were abundant, suggesting that Crenarchaeota might largely lack the amoA gene in these deep-water environs (Agogué et al., 2008; De Corte et al., 2009).;  Specifically, we collected samples from a depth of 3480 m in the Tyrrhenian Sea (Central Mediterranean) and examined the resident bathypelagic community for abundance of crenarchaeal amoA genes in relation to corresponding transcripts and cell numbers.;  To our knowledge, these are the first publicly available gene sequences for deep-sea crenarchaea of Mediterranean Sea.; Seawater samples were obtained from the Southern Tyrrhenian area of Mediterranean Sea (monitoring station 17 or V2 (39°32.050′N and 13°22.280′E)) from onboard the RV Urania during the CIESM-SUB2 (December 2005) and VECTOR-TM2 (February 2007) cruises.;  Samples from the different depths (200, 400 (OMZ), 2000 and 3480 m) were collected using 12-l Niskin bottles housed on a rosette (General Oceanics, Miami, FL, USA) equipped with SBE-911plus conductivity–temperature–depth sensors (Sea-Bird Electronics, Bellevue, WA, USA).;  All running standards were prepared with Low Nutrient Seawater and calibrated against Ocean Scientific standards (OSIL, Hampshir, UK).;  Seawater samples (1000 ml) collected at different depths were directly transferred to glass bottles, fixed with particle-free formaldehyde (2% final concentration) and stored at 4 °C for 12 h.; We checked all sequences to remove chimeric sequences using the Chimera check program at Ribosomal Database Project (Cole et al., 2005) and Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) analysis of sequence segments (Altschul et al., 1997).;  The ratio of 14C-labelled bicarbonate to total inorganic C in the sample was determined using an average concentration of total TCO2 of 2.29±0.01 m, measured in seawater column in the Southern Tyrrhenian Sea at the time of sampling (Rivaro et al., 2010).; The Tyrrhenia Sea is a three-layer system in which the top layer (0–200 m) is occupied by the so-called Modified Atlantic Water (0–250 m), originated from the water entering at Gibraltar from the Atlantic Ocean.;  The observed differences between eury- and crenarchaeotal presence in deep Tyrrhenian Sea might be a common phenomenon and is consistent with the findings of other studies (DeLong et al., 2006; Martin-Cuadrado et al., 2007, 2008; Mincer et al., 2007; De Corte et al., 2009; Yakimov et al., 2009).; Phylogenetic tree of the archaeal 16S rRNA gene sequences retrieved from deep Tyrrhenian Sea (3480 m).; The abundance of Crenarchaeota MGI.1a in the deep Tyrrhenian Sea corroborated with significant abundance of crenarchaeal amoA gene as revealed by QPCR: the number of amoA gene copies found at the depth of 3480 m in Tyrrhenian Sea (7000±475 copies per ml) was essentially the same as the number of crenarchaeal cells (5950±360 cells ml−1) counted at this site with CARD-FISH, resulting in amoA to crenarchaeal cells ratio of 1.18.;  A similar ratio (1.31) was obtained previously at another deep-sea site in Tyrrhenian Sea (monitoring Station 4, (39°32.050′N, 13°22.280′E)) (Yakimov et al., 2009).;  In contrast, Agogué et al.

(2004) identified a putative ammonia monooxygenase (amoA)-like gene in an apparent archaeon-derived scaffold, and thus suggested ammonia (NH3) oxidation to be attributed to crenarchaea.;  Studies performed in deep North Atlantic and Eastern Mediterranean Sea revealed that archaeal amoA gene abundance was rather low even though 16S rRNA genes of MGI of Crenarchaeota were abundant, suggesting that Crenarchaeota might largely lack the amoA gene in these deep-water environs (Agogué et al., 2008; De Corte et al., 2009).;  Specifically, we collected samples from a depth of 3480 m in the Tyrrhenian Sea (Central Mediterranean) and examined the resident bathypelagic community for abundance of crenarchaeal amoA genes in relation to corresponding transcripts and cell numbers.;  To our knowledge, these are the first publicly available gene sequences for deep-sea crenarchaea of Mediterranean Sea.; Seawater samples were obtained from the Southern Tyrrhenian area of Mediterranean Sea (monitoring station 17 or V2 (39°32.050′N and 13°22.280′E)) from onboard the RV Urania during the CIESM-SUB2 (December 2005) and VECTOR-TM2 (February 2007) cruises.;  Samples from the different depths (200, 400 (OMZ), 2000 and 3480 m) were collected using 12-l Niskin bottles housed on a rosette (General Oceanics, Miami, FL, USA) equipped with SBE-911plus conductivity–temperature–depth sensors (Sea-Bird Electronics, Bellevue, WA, USA).;  All running standards were prepared with Low Nutrient Seawater and calibrated against Ocean Scientific standards (OSIL, Hampshir, UK).;  Seawater samples (1000 ml) collected at different depths were directly transferred to glass bottles, fixed with particle-free formaldehyde (2% final concentration) and stored at 4 °C for 12 h.; We checked all sequences to remove chimeric sequences using the Chimera check program at Ribosomal Database Project (Cole et al., 2005) and Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) analysis of sequence segments (Altschul et al., 1997).;  The ratio of 14C-labelled bicarbonate to total inorganic C in the sample was determined using an average concentration of total TCO2 of 2.29±0.01 m, measured in seawater column in the Southern Tyrrhenian Sea at the time of sampling (Rivaro et al., 2010).; The Tyrrhenia Sea is a three-layer system in which the top layer (0–200 m) is occupied by the so-called Modified Atlantic Water (0–250 m), originated from the water entering at Gibraltar from the Atlantic Ocean.;  The observed differences between eury- and crenarchaeotal presence in deep Tyrrhenian Sea might be a common phenomenon and is consistent with the findings of other studies (DeLong et al., 2006; Martin-Cuadrado et al., 2007, 2008; Mincer et al., 2007; De Corte et al., 2009; Yakimov et al., 2009).; Phylogenetic tree of the archaeal 16S rRNA gene sequences retrieved from deep Tyrrhenian Sea (3480 m).; The abundance of Crenarchaeota MGI.1a in the deep Tyrrhenian Sea corroborated with significant abundance of crenarchaeal amoA gene as revealed by QPCR: the number of amoA gene copies found at the depth of 3480 m in Tyrrhenian Sea (7000±475 copies per ml) was essentially the same as the number of crenarchaeal cells (5950±360 cells ml−1) counted at this site with CARD-FISH, resulting in amoA to crenarchaeal cells ratio of 1.18.;  A similar ratio (1.31) was obtained previously at another deep-sea site in Tyrrhenian Sea (monitoring Station 4, (39°32.050′N, 13°22.280′E)) (Yakimov et al., 2009).;  In contrast, Agogué et al.

21209665,3131861," The median value of the crenachaeal cell to amoA gene ratio was close to one suggesting that virtually all deep-sea Crenarchaeota possess the capacity to oxidize ammonia.;  Crenarchaea-specific genes, nirK and ureC, for nitrite reductase and urease were identified and their affiliation demonstrated the presence of ‘deep-sea' clades distinct from ‘shallow' representatives.;  Measured deep-sea dark CO2 fixation estimates were comparable to the median value of photosynthetic biomass production calculated for this area of Tyrrhenian Sea, pointing to the significance of this process in the C cycle of aphotic marine ecosystems.;  As in case of nirK and ureC, these genes are grouped with deep-sea sequences being distantly related to those retrieved from the epipelagic zone.;  However, Crenarchaeota are abundant in bathypelagic (1000–4000-m depth) NH3-depleted waters as well (Karner et al., 2001; Delong et al., 2006; Teira et al., 2006; Martin-Cuadrado et al., 2007; Agogué et al., 2008; Varela et al., 2008) and, despite of their potential importance to the marine nitrogen (N) cycle, there is only limited information available on the distribution and physiological activities of these deep-sea organisms.;  While studying the archaeal amoA gene distribution in the bathypelagic waters, the question arose whether all deep-sea Crenarchaeota contribute to NH3 oxidation (Mincer et al., 2007; Agogué et al., 2008; De Corte et al., 2009; Church et al., 2010).;  Thus, researchers have postulated the existence of a specific heterotrophic amoA gene-lacking Crenarchaeota, that prefer deep ocean waters (Agogué et al., 2008).;  To our knowledge, these are the first publicly available gene sequences for deep-sea crenarchaea of Mediterranean Sea.;  Deep-sea primary production rates were studied in on-deck experiments under the influence of various chemical and physical factors.;  Microbial cells were collected by gentle filtration of 40–120 ml seawater portions onto 0.2-μm pore size, 47-mm diameter white polycarbonate filters GTTP (Millipore, Molsheim, France), which were then rinsed with sterile seawater, air-dried and stored at −20 °C until further processing as described by Tamburini et al. (2009).; For nucleic acid extraction, three Niskin bottles were casted at each depth and seawater was immediately filtered onboard with Sterivex capsules (0.2 μm pore size, Millipore), using a peristaltic pump.; Rates of CO2 fixation were determined by the incorporation of NaH14CO3 into particulate organic matter during radiotracing of water samples incubated at the in situ temperature (13 °C) immediately after cast retrieval on board of the research vessel.;  Three replicate gas-tight 60-ml serum vials were filled with 40 ml of 1 μm-prefiltered seawater collected at 200, 400 (OMZ), 2000 and 3480 m and 10 μCi of [14C]HCO3 (52 mCi m−1, Amersham Italia, Milan, Italy) was added to each tube.;  Filters were washed three times with 10 ml of filtered (0.1 μm) seawater, acidified in an HCl fume hood for 12 h (to remove inorganic carbon) and air-dried before addition of scintillation cocktail for 14C counting in a Wallac 1414 analyzer (PerkinElmer, Monza, Italy).;  The ratio of 14C-labelled bicarbonate to total inorganic C in the sample was determined using an average concentration of total TCO2 of 2.29±0.01 m, measured in seawater column in the Southern Tyrrhenian Sea at the time of sampling (Rivaro et al., 2010).; In order to determine the eventual assimilation of labeled inorganic C into biomarkers and identify the organisms important in deep-sea primary production, 200 μCi of [14C]HCO3 was added to 200 ml of 1 μm-prefiltered seawater collected from the depth of 3480 m and incubated in the gas-tight 500 ml flask at in situ water temperature (13 °C) in the dark for 7 days.;  The filtered files were submitted for database search using MASCOT search engine version 2.3.01 (Matrix Science, London, UK).;  The search was performed in NCBI non-redundant 20100903 database (11 744 690 sequences).;  The following search parameters were used: enzyme, trypsin; allowed missed cleavages, 1; fixed modifications, ß-methylthiolation of cysteine; variable modifications, oxidation of methionine and acetylation (N-term); mass tolerance for precursors was set to ±100 p.p.m. and for MS/MS fragment ions to ±0.8 Da.; Sequences of N. maritimus SCM1 and C. symbiosum A genes were queried against the NCBI non-redundant protein database using both BLASTP and BLASTX search with a cut-off value of <1e-50.;  For comparative analysis, reciprocal BLASTN and TBLASTX searches between the different fosmids, scaffolds and genomic fragments were carried out, leading to the identification of regions of similarity, insertions and rearrangements.;  A similar ratio (1.31) was obtained previously at another deep-sea site in Tyrrhenian Sea (monitoring Station 4, (39°32.050′N, 13°22.280′E)) (Yakimov et al., 2009).;  Estimates of amoA to total crenarchaeal 16S rRNA gene ratio (median value 1.3) observed in deep-sea environments in other parts of the world, did not vary significantly and have been used to indicate that the marine crenarchaea all possess the ability to perform nitrification (Wuchter et al., 2006; Mincer et al., 2007; Beman et al., 2008; Church et al., 2010; Park et al., 2010).;  It should be noted, however, that a recent metagenomic study of deep sea microbial communities indicated that the reported low archaeal amoA/16S rRNA gene copy number for deep sea crenarchaea may be erroneous due to mismatches in the primers (Konstantinidis et al., 2009; Church et al., 2010).;  Similar values were observed in the mesopelagic waters of the Pacific Ocean (Church et al., 2010), reflecting similarity in corresponding metabolic activity of crenarchaeal deep-sea communities worldwide.;  To date, there is only limited information available on factors regulating transcription of amoA in of ammonia-oxidizing Crenarchaeota in the deep sea.;  The sampling biases, such as duration of deep-sea sampling cast, time intervals between cast recovery and sample freezing and fixation and the effect of decompression, could also affect the measurement of actual amoA expression in deep sea (Yakimov et al., 2009).;  Two deep-sea ALOHA fosmids, HF4000_APKG4H17 and HF4000_APKG3E18 contained an incomplete amoAB operon along with the stretch of several predicted open reading frames highly syntenic at the amino-acid level to a 11-Kb genomic fragment situated downstream of the N. maritimus SCM1 amoACB operon (Supplementary Figure S2).;  The psi-BLAST and tBLASTX searches for N. maritimus SCM1 amoC homologs, revealed the presence of a relevant sequence in HF4000_ANIW97M7 fosmid recovered from the ALOHA deep-sea database.;  The remaining nirK clone was affiliated with N. maritimus genes and GOS sequences retrieved from superficial seawater.;  Both marine nirK clades were represented by the sequences retrieved exclusively from epi and bathypelagic seawater, and exhibited high divergence with ‘soil' and ‘thermophilic' crenarchaeal and bacterial nirK clades (Figure 3).;  In total, 84 of 93 sequenced clones were found to be affiliated with four related sub-clades and were similar to ureC homologs in two deep-sea fosmids from ALOHA Station, namely HOTS_contig35539 and HF4000ANIW13304 (Figure 4).; The rates of prokaryotic dark primary production in seawater column at Station 17 were estimated by incorporation of 14C-labeled bicarbonate into the microbial biomass.;  Downward 2000 m, within the layer of TDW, autotrophic activity declined to the values of 50–60 μgC m−3 per day and remained constant down to the sea bed (Figure 5).;  The deep-sea dark CO2 fixation values measured in our study corroborated with earlier estimates (72.0±8.9 μgC m−3 per day) determined in this area at the depth of 3000 m (Tamburini et al., 2009) and seem to be a characteristic feature of TDW, representing the densest, oldest and highly oligotrophic deep water masses of Mediterranean Sea (Millot et al., 2006).;  By applying of obtained values to whole aphotic water column (from 200 m to the seafloor), we estimated the mean dark ocean production at Station 17 as 257 mgC m−2 per day, which is comparable to the median value of photosynthetic biomass production (273–429 mgC m−2 per day) calculated for this area of Tyrrhenian Sea (Decembrini et al., 2009).;  We tested this hypothesis by addition of 500 μmol l−1 of urea to the seawater samples and measured [14C]HCO3 fixation rates were compared with those of untreated and NH4+-supplemented experiments.;  Even though there is a further need in elucidation of the mechanism of this phenomenon, our observation indicates that autotrophic members of deep-sea microbial community can catabolize urea to fuel their metabolism.;  Depletion of oxygen in the deep seawater samples by addition of sulfide caused a slight decrease in primary production rates compared with untreated control (P=0.018).;  The exposure of the deep seawater samples to full daylight (12 000 lux) also had a slightly negative effect on primary production rates (72±15% productivity of the control, P=0.042).;  As was recently proposed (Mincer et al., 2007; Church et al., 2010), this effect could be explained by partial photo-inhibition of deep-sea AmoA proteins.; Influence of various additives and physical factors on primary production rates measured in seawater samples collected at 3480 m.;  As it was already demonstrated for the ammonia-oxidizing thermophilic crenarchaea (Hatzenpichler et al., 2008), an addition of 86 μ allylthiourea, known inhibitor of bacterial ammonium monooxygenase, did not cause significant decline in autotrophic activity of deep-sea Crenarchaeota.;  Because of the general sensitivity of the corresponding enzymes to the oxygen, only two pathways, namely Calvin–Benson–Bassham and 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate (3-HP/4-HB) cycles, could occur in oxygenated seawater (Thauer, 2007; Berg et al., 2007, 2010a, 2010b).;  The rest of accA-like clones formed the ‘Ecotype_1', which also includes the sequences from bathypelagic seawater (4000 m depth) from North Pacific Subtropical Gyre, Hawaii Ocean Time Series Station ALOHA (DeLong et al., 2006;

21209665,3131861," The median value of the crenachaeal cell to amoA gene ratio was close to one suggesting that virtually all deep-sea Crenarchaeota possess the capacity to oxidize ammonia.;  Crenarchaea-specific genes, nirK and ureC, for nitrite reductase and urease were identified and their affiliation demonstrated the presence of ‘deep-sea' clades distinct from ‘shallow' representatives.;  Measured deep-sea dark CO2 fixation estimates were comparable to the median value of photosynthetic biomass production calculated for this area of Tyrrhenian Sea, pointing to the significance of this process in the C cycle of aphotic marine ecosystems.;  As in case of nirK and ureC, these genes are grouped with deep-sea sequences being distantly related to those retrieved from the epipelagic zone.;  However, Crenarchaeota are abundant in bathypelagic (1000–4000-m depth) NH3-depleted waters as well (Karner et al., 2001; Delong et al., 2006; Teira et al., 2006; Martin-Cuadrado et al., 2007; Agogué et al., 2008; Varela et al., 2008) and, despite of their potential importance to the marine nitrogen (N) cycle, there is only limited information available on the distribution and physiological activities of these deep-sea organisms.;  While studying the archaeal amoA gene distribution in the bathypelagic waters, the question arose whether all deep-sea Crenarchaeota contribute to NH3 oxidation (Mincer et al., 2007; Agogué et al., 2008; De Corte et al., 2009; Church et al., 2010).;  Thus, researchers have postulated the existence of a specific heterotrophic amoA gene-lacking Crenarchaeota, that prefer deep ocean waters (Agogué et al., 2008).;  To our knowledge, these are the first publicly available gene sequences for deep-sea crenarchaea of Mediterranean Sea.;  Deep-sea primary production rates were studied in on-deck experiments under the influence of various chemical and physical factors.;  Microbial cells were collected by gentle filtration of 40–120 ml seawater portions onto 0.2-μm pore size, 47-mm diameter white polycarbonate filters GTTP (Millipore, Molsheim, France), which were then rinsed with sterile seawater, air-dried and stored at −20 °C until further processing as described by Tamburini et al. (2009).; For nucleic acid extraction, three Niskin bottles were casted at each depth and seawater was immediately filtered onboard with Sterivex capsules (0.2 μm pore size, Millipore), using a peristaltic pump.; Rates of CO2 fixation were determined by the incorporation of NaH14CO3 into particulate organic matter during radiotracing of water samples incubated at the in situ temperature (13 °C) immediately after cast retrieval on board of the research vessel.;  Three replicate gas-tight 60-ml serum vials were filled with 40 ml of 1 μm-prefiltered seawater collected at 200, 400 (OMZ), 2000 and 3480 m and 10 μCi of [14C]HCO3 (52 mCi m−1, Amersham Italia, Milan, Italy) was added to each tube.;  Filters were washed three times with 10 ml of filtered (0.1 μm) seawater, acidified in an HCl fume hood for 12 h (to remove inorganic carbon) and air-dried before addition of scintillation cocktail for 14C counting in a Wallac 1414 analyzer (PerkinElmer, Monza, Italy).;  The ratio of 14C-labelled bicarbonate to total inorganic C in the sample was determined using an average concentration of total TCO2 of 2.29±0.01 m, measured in seawater column in the Southern Tyrrhenian Sea at the time of sampling (Rivaro et al., 2010).; In order to determine the eventual assimilation of labeled inorganic C into biomarkers and identify the organisms important in deep-sea primary production, 200 μCi of [14C]HCO3 was added to 200 ml of 1 μm-prefiltered seawater collected from the depth of 3480 m and incubated in the gas-tight 500 ml flask at in situ water temperature (13 °C) in the dark for 7 days.;  The filtered files were submitted for database search using MASCOT search engine version 2.3.01 (Matrix Science, London, UK).;  The search was performed in NCBI non-redundant 20100903 database (11 744 690 sequences).;  The following search parameters were used: enzyme, trypsin; allowed missed cleavages, 1; fixed modifications, ß-methylthiolation of cysteine; variable modifications, oxidation of methionine and acetylation (N-term); mass tolerance for precursors was set to ±100 p.p.m. and for MS/MS fragment ions to ±0.8 Da.; Sequences of N. maritimus SCM1 and C. symbiosum A genes were queried against the NCBI non-redundant protein database using both BLASTP and BLASTX search with a cut-off value of <1e-50.;  For comparative analysis, reciprocal BLASTN and TBLASTX searches between the different fosmids, scaffolds and genomic fragments were carried out, leading to the identification of regions of similarity, insertions and rearrangements.;  A similar ratio (1.31) was obtained previously at another deep-sea site in Tyrrhenian Sea (monitoring Station 4, (39°32.050′N, 13°22.280′E)) (Yakimov et al., 2009).;  Estimates of amoA to total crenarchaeal 16S rRNA gene ratio (median value 1.3) observed in deep-sea environments in other parts of the world, did not vary significantly and have been used to indicate that the marine crenarchaea all possess the ability to perform nitrification (Wuchter et al., 2006; Mincer et al., 2007; Beman et al., 2008; Church et al., 2010; Park et al., 2010).;  It should be noted, however, that a recent metagenomic study of deep sea microbial communities indicated that the reported low archaeal amoA/16S rRNA gene copy number for deep sea crenarchaea may be erroneous due to mismatches in the primers (Konstantinidis et al., 2009; Church et al., 2010).;  Similar values were observed in the mesopelagic waters of the Pacific Ocean (Church et al., 2010), reflecting similarity in corresponding metabolic activity of crenarchaeal deep-sea communities worldwide.;  To date, there is only limited information available on factors regulating transcription of amoA in of ammonia-oxidizing Crenarchaeota in the deep sea.;  The sampling biases, such as duration of deep-sea sampling cast, time intervals between cast recovery and sample freezing and fixation and the effect of decompression, could also affect the measurement of actual amoA expression in deep sea (Yakimov et al., 2009).;  Two deep-sea ALOHA fosmids, HF4000_APKG4H17 and HF4000_APKG3E18 contained an incomplete amoAB operon along with the stretch of several predicted open reading frames highly syntenic at the amino-acid level to a 11-Kb genomic fragment situated downstream of the N. maritimus SCM1 amoACB operon (Supplementary Figure S2).;  The psi-BLAST and tBLASTX searches for N. maritimus SCM1 amoC homologs, revealed the presence of a relevant sequence in HF4000_ANIW97M7 fosmid recovered from the ALOHA deep-sea database.;  The remaining nirK clone was affiliated with N. maritimus genes and GOS sequences retrieved from superficial seawater.;  Both marine nirK clades were represented by the sequences retrieved exclusively from epi and bathypelagic seawater, and exhibited high divergence with ‘soil' and ‘thermophilic' crenarchaeal and bacterial nirK clades (Figure 3).;  In total, 84 of 93 sequenced clones were found to be affiliated with four related sub-clades and were similar to ureC homologs in two deep-sea fosmids from ALOHA Station, namely HOTS_contig35539 and HF4000ANIW13304 (Figure 4).; The rates of prokaryotic dark primary production in seawater column at Station 17 were estimated by incorporation of 14C-labeled bicarbonate into the microbial biomass.;  Downward 2000 m, within the layer of TDW, autotrophic activity declined to the values of 50–60 μgC m−3 per day and remained constant down to the sea bed (Figure 5).;  The deep-sea dark CO2 fixation values measured in our study corroborated with earlier estimates (72.0±8.9 μgC m−3 per day) determined in this area at the depth of 3000 m (Tamburini et al., 2009) and seem to be a characteristic feature of TDW, representing the densest, oldest and highly oligotrophic deep water masses of Mediterranean Sea (Millot et al., 2006).;  By applying of obtained values to whole aphotic water column (from 200 m to the seafloor), we estimated the mean dark ocean production at Station 17 as 257 mgC m−2 per day, which is comparable to the median value of photosynthetic biomass production (273–429 mgC m−2 per day) calculated for this area of Tyrrhenian Sea (Decembrini et al., 2009).;  We tested this hypothesis by addition of 500 μmol l−1 of urea to the seawater samples and measured [14C]HCO3 fixation rates were compared with those of untreated and NH4+-supplemented experiments.;  Even though there is a further need in elucidation of the mechanism of this phenomenon, our observation indicates that autotrophic members of deep-sea microbial community can catabolize urea to fuel their metabolism.;  Depletion of oxygen in the deep seawater samples by addition of sulfide caused a slight decrease in primary production rates compared with untreated control (P=0.018).;  The exposure of the deep seawater samples to full daylight (12 000 lux) also had a slightly negative effect on primary production rates (72±15% productivity of the control, P=0.042).;  As was recently proposed (Mincer et al., 2007; Church et al., 2010), this effect could be explained by partial photo-inhibition of deep-sea AmoA proteins.; Influence of various additives and physical factors on primary production rates measured in seawater samples collected at 3480 m.;  As it was already demonstrated for the ammonia-oxidizing thermophilic crenarchaea (Hatzenpichler et al., 2008), an addition of 86 μ allylthiourea, known inhibitor of bacterial ammonium monooxygenase, did not cause significant decline in autotrophic activity of deep-sea Crenarchaeota.;  Because of the general sensitivity of the corresponding enzymes to the oxygen, only two pathways, namely Calvin–Benson–Bassham and 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate (3-HP/4-HB) cycles, could occur in oxygenated seawater (Thauer, 2007; Berg et al., 2007, 2010a, 2010b).;  The rest of accA-like clones formed the ‘Ecotype_1', which also includes the sequences from bathypelagic seawater (4000 m depth) from North Pacific Subtropical Gyre, Hawaii Ocean Time Series Station ALOHA (DeLong et al., 2006;

 The deep-sea dark CO2 fixation values measured in our study corroborated with earlier estimates (72.0±8.9 μgC m−3 per day) determined in this area at the depth of 3000 m (Tamburini et al., 2009) and seem to be a characteristic feature of TDW, representing the densest, oldest and highly oligotrophic deep water masses of Mediterranean Sea (Millot et al., 2006).;  By applying of obtained values to whole aphotic water column (from 200 m to the seafloor), we estimated the mean dark ocean production at Station 17 as 257 mgC m−2 per day, which is comparable to the median value of photosynthetic biomass production (273–429 mgC m−2 per day) calculated for this area of Tyrrhenian Sea (Decembrini et al., 2009).;  We tested this hypothesis by addition of 500 μmol l−1 of urea to the seawater samples and measured [14C]HCO3 fixation rates were compared with those of untreated and NH4+-supplemented experiments.;  Even though there is a further need in elucidation of the mechanism of this phenomenon, our observation indicates that autotrophic members of deep-sea microbial community can catabolize urea to fuel their metabolism.;  Depletion of oxygen in the deep seawater samples by addition of sulfide caused a slight decrease in primary production rates compared with untreated control (P=0.018).;  The exposure of the deep seawater samples to full daylight (12 000 lux) also had a slightly negative effect on primary production rates (72±15% productivity of the control, P=0.042).;  As was recently proposed (Mincer et al., 2007; Church et al., 2010), this effect could be explained by partial photo-inhibition of deep-sea AmoA proteins.; Influence of various additives and physical factors on primary production rates measured in seawater samples collected at 3480 m.;  As it was already demonstrated for the ammonia-oxidizing thermophilic crenarchaea (Hatzenpichler et al., 2008), an addition of 86 μ allylthiourea, known inhibitor of bacterial ammonium monooxygenase, did not cause significant decline in autotrophic activity of deep-sea Crenarchaeota.;  Because of the general sensitivity of the corresponding enzymes to the oxygen, only two pathways, namely Calvin–Benson–Bassham and 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate (3-HP/4-HB) cycles, could occur in oxygenated seawater (Thauer, 2007; Berg et al., 2007, 2010a, 2010b).;  The rest of accA-like clones formed the ‘Ecotype_1', which also includes the sequences from bathypelagic seawater (4000 m depth) from North Pacific Subtropical Gyre, Hawaii Ocean Time Series Station ALOHA (DeLong et al., 2006; Mincer et al., 2007).;  The clones attributed to deep-sea Crenarchaeota lineage are shown in details in the insert.;  Therefore, this group of chemoautotrophic prokaryotes, numerically dominating deep-sea microbial communities worldwide, might represent an important and hitherto unrecognized driver for sink of inorganic carbon in the largest oceanic subsystem embracing mesopelagic and bathypelagic zone.;  Therefore, further studies, including metagenomic and proteomic approaches and cultivation under in situ conditions, are necessary to overcome this circumstance and to provide important new insights into the mechanisms of element cycling in the deep-sea environment.",sea,carbon,,up
21209665,3131861," The median value of the crenachaeal cell to amoA gene ratio was close to one suggesting that virtually all deep-sea Crenarchaeota possess the capacity to oxidize ammonia.;  Crenarchaea-specific genes, nirK and ureC, for nitrite reductase and urease were identified and their affiliation demonstrated the presence of ‘deep-sea' clades distinct from ‘shallow' representatives.;  Measured deep-sea dark CO2 fixation estimates were comparable to the median value of photosynthetic biomass production calculated for this area of Tyrrhenian Sea, pointing to the significance of this process in the C cycle of aphotic marine ecosystems.;  As in case of nirK and ureC, these genes are grouped with deep-sea sequences being distantly related to those retrieved from the epipelagic zone.;  However, Crenarchaeota are abundant in bathypelagic (1000–4000-m depth) NH3-depleted waters as well (Karner et al., 2001; Delong et al., 2006; Teira et al., 2006; Martin-Cuadrado et al., 2007; Agogué et al., 2008; Varela et al., 2008) and, despite of their potential importance to the marine nitrogen (N) cycle, there is only limited information available on the distribution and physiological activities of these deep-sea organisms.;  While studying the archaeal amoA gene distribution in the bathypelagic waters, the question arose whether all deep-sea Crenarchaeota contribute to NH3 oxidation (Mincer et al., 2007; Agogué et al., 2008; De Corte et al., 2009; Church et al., 2010).;  Thus, researchers have postulated the existence of a specific heterotrophic amoA gene-lacking Crenarchaeota, that prefer deep ocean waters (Agogué et al., 2008).;  To our knowledge, these are the first publicly available gene sequences for deep-sea crenarchaea of Mediterranean Sea.;  Deep-sea primary production rates were studied in on-deck experiments under the influence of various chemical and physical factors.;  Microbial cells were collected by gentle filtration of 40–120 ml seawater portions onto 0.2-μm pore size, 47-mm diameter white polycarbonate filters GTTP (Millipore, Molsheim, France), which were then rinsed with sterile seawater, air-dried and stored at −20 °C until further processing as described by Tamburini et al. (2009).; For nucleic acid extraction, three Niskin bottles were casted at each depth and seawater was immediately filtered onboard with Sterivex capsules (0.2 μm pore size, Millipore), using a peristaltic pump.; Rates of CO2 fixation were determined by the incorporation of NaH14CO3 into particulate organic matter during radiotracing of water samples incubated at the in situ temperature (13 °C) immediately after cast retrieval on board of the research vessel.;  Three replicate gas-tight 60-ml serum vials were filled with 40 ml of 1 μm-prefiltered seawater collected at 200, 400 (OMZ), 2000 and 3480 m and 10 μCi of [14C]HCO3 (52 mCi m−1, Amersham Italia, Milan, Italy) was added to each tube.;  Filters were washed three times with 10 ml of filtered (0.1 μm) seawater, acidified in an HCl fume hood for 12 h (to remove inorganic carbon) and air-dried before addition of scintillation cocktail for 14C counting in a Wallac 1414 analyzer (PerkinElmer, Monza, Italy).;  The ratio of 14C-labelled bicarbonate to total inorganic C in the sample was determined using an average concentration of total TCO2 of 2.29±0.01 m, measured in seawater column in the Southern Tyrrhenian Sea at the time of sampling (Rivaro et al., 2010).; In order to determine the eventual assimilation of labeled inorganic C into biomarkers and identify the organisms important in deep-sea primary production, 200 μCi of [14C]HCO3 was added to 200 ml of 1 μm-prefiltered seawater collected from the depth of 3480 m and incubated in the gas-tight 500 ml flask at in situ water temperature (13 °C) in the dark for 7 days.;  The filtered files were submitted for database search using MASCOT search engine version 2.3.01 (Matrix Science, London, UK).;  The search was performed in NCBI non-redundant 20100903 database (11 744 690 sequences).;  The following search parameters were used: enzyme, trypsin; allowed missed cleavages, 1; fixed modifications, ß-methylthiolation of cysteine; variable modifications, oxidation of methionine and acetylation (N-term); mass tolerance for precursors was set to ±100 p.p.m. and for MS/MS fragment ions to ±0.8 Da.; Sequences of N. maritimus SCM1 and C. symbiosum A genes were queried against the NCBI non-redundant protein database using both BLASTP and BLASTX search with a cut-off value of <1e-50.;  For comparative analysis, reciprocal BLASTN and TBLASTX searches between the different fosmids, scaffolds and genomic fragments were carried out, leading to the identification of regions of similarity, insertions and rearrangements.;  A similar ratio (1.31) was obtained previously at another deep-sea site in Tyrrhenian Sea (monitoring Station 4, (39°32.050′N, 13°22.280′E)) (Yakimov et al., 2009).;  Estimates of amoA to total crenarchaeal 16S rRNA gene ratio (median value 1.3) observed in deep-sea environments in other parts of the world, did not vary significantly and have been used to indicate that the marine crenarchaea all possess the ability to perform nitrification (Wuchter et al., 2006; Mincer et al., 2007; Beman et al., 2008; Church et al., 2010; Park et al., 2010).;  It should be noted, however, that a recent metagenomic study of deep sea microbial communities indicated that the reported low archaeal amoA/16S rRNA gene copy number for deep sea crenarchaea may be erroneous due to mismatches in the primers (Konstantinidis et al., 2009; Church et al., 2010).;  Similar values were observed in the mesopelagic waters of the Pacific Ocean (Church et al., 2010), reflecting similarity in corresponding metabolic activity of crenarchaeal deep-sea communities worldwide.;  To date, there is only limited information available on factors regulating transcription of amoA in of ammonia-oxidizing Crenarchaeota in the deep sea.;  The sampling biases, such as duration of deep-sea sampling cast, time intervals between cast recovery and sample freezing and fixation and the effect of decompression, could also affect the measurement of actual amoA expression in deep sea (Yakimov et al., 2009).;  Two deep-sea ALOHA fosmids, HF4000_APKG4H17 and HF4000_APKG3E18 contained an incomplete amoAB operon along with the stretch of several predicted open reading frames highly syntenic at the amino-acid level to a 11-Kb genomic fragment situated downstream of the N. maritimus SCM1 amoACB operon (Supplementary Figure S2).;  The psi-BLAST and tBLASTX searches for N. maritimus SCM1 amoC homologs, revealed the presence of a relevant sequence in HF4000_ANIW97M7 fosmid recovered from the ALOHA deep-sea database.;  The remaining nirK clone was affiliated with N. maritimus genes and GOS sequences retrieved from superficial seawater.;  Both marine nirK clades were represented by the sequences retrieved exclusively from epi and bathypelagic seawater, and exhibited high divergence with ‘soil' and ‘thermophilic' crenarchaeal and bacterial nirK clades (Figure 3).;  In total, 84 of 93 sequenced clones were found to be affiliated with four related sub-clades and were similar to ureC homologs in two deep-sea fosmids from ALOHA Station, namely HOTS_contig35539 and HF4000ANIW13304 (Figure 4).;

21106571,3097850,"An intriguing new annelid, Teuthidodrilus samae (Annelida, Cirratuliformia) gen. and sp. nov., was observed and collected during deep-water column exploration of the western Celebes Sea.;  The Celebes Sea is a deep pocket basin, effectively isolated from surrounding deep water, and is part of the Coral Triangle, a focal area for conservation because of its high diversity and unique geological history.; The Celebes Sea (figure 1a) is a deep basin (maximum depth approx. 6200 m) located between the Philippines and Indonesia, which is thought to have formed in the Eocene (44–42 Myr ago) far from any major land mass [1]. During the Pleistocene, the basin was isolated by significantly lower sea level that exposed surrounding islands.;  Density differences inhibit water flowing over the sills from mixing with basin water, resulting in long residence times for water below 1500 m [2]. The basin is at the centre of the Coral Triangle, an area now considered a conservation hotspot owing to the high diversity and endemism of shallow-water corals and fishes [3]. This area is also the centre of geographical distributions and diversity of lanternfish, hatchetfish, dragonfish and anglerfish [4]. Based on the unique geology and history of the basin and the extreme diversity of the shallow-water fauna, the hypothesis that the deep fauna may be equivalently diverse and unique was a motivation for the exploratory expedition to the Celebes Sea.

32355379,7175662,"Prompted by recent observations of seasonal low dissolved oxygen from two moorings in the North Sea, a hydrographic survey in August 2010 mapped the spatial extent of summer oxygen depletion.;  Typical near-bed dissolved oxygen saturations in the stratified regions of the North Sea were 75–80 % while the well-mixed regions of the southern North Sea reached 90 %. Two regions of strong thermal stratification, the area between the Dooley and Central North Sea Currents and the area known as the Oyster Grounds, had oxygen saturations as low as 65 and 70 % (200 and 180 μmol dm−3) respectively.;  Historical data over the last century from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea oceanographic database highlight an increase in seasonal oxygen depletion and a warming over the past 20 years.;  Hypoxia is defined as oxygen concentrations below 4–6 mg dm−3 (125–190 μmol dm−3) by the Oslo and Paris Commission (OSPAR) in the Ecological Quality Objective (EcoQO) for the North Sea (Painting et al. 2005).; The review by Colijn et al. (2002) highlighted a paucity of studies assessing the impacts of low oxygen regions on organisms and ecosystems in the North Sea.;  Both the Water Framework Directive and the Shellfish Waters Directive apply only to coastal waters; offshore waters of the North Sea are covered by the OSPAR Commission.;  Weston et al. (2008) conjecture that climate change scenarios in the North Sea could see a decrease in BML dissolved oxygen due to increasing temperatures: a temperature increase of 2–3 °C will decrease oxygen solubility by 0.4 mg dm−3 (13 μmol dm−3) at atmospheric pressure.; For bottom waters to have reduced oxygen content they must be isolated from sources of oxygen saturated water by a strong pycnocline and have weak advection; thus the residual circulation of the North Sea affects the supply of dissolved oxygen.;  The circulation in the North Sea results from a combination of wind-induced flow, topographically-steered currents and density-driven flow resulting in relatively narrow jets (Brown et al. 1999; Hill et al. 2008).;  The semi-enclosed situation of the North Sea, coupled with the various inflows lead to an anticlockwise circulation.;  Very little inflow from the northern boundary reaches south of the Dogger Bank; instead this water circulates north of the Dogger Bank to rejoin southern waters before exiting the North Sea through the Norwegian Trench (Thomas et al. 2005).;  It is generally agreed that water in the North Sea has a residence time in the order of 0.6–1 year (Jickells 1998; Otto et al. 1990; Thomas et al. 2005; Van Raaphorst et al. 1998; Vermaat et al. 2008).

The North Sea exhibits a generally vertically well mixed pattern in winter with occasional stratification in the deepest regions (Ducrotoy et al. 2000; Sharples et al. 2006).;  In the stratified North Sea, stratification becomes apparent from mid-April, with a thermocline at a typical depth of 30 m in the north (Ducrotoy et al. 2000; Sharples et al. 2006; Greenwood et al. 2010).; There have been recent reports of low dissolved oxygen in the North Sea.;  Hence, the aims of this study are firstly to place the recent evidence of seasonally low oxygen at two sites in the North Sea in a spatial context based on a major survey of oxygen concentrations in the summer of 2010; secondly to assess the evolution of summer oxygen depletion in the North Sea over the past century using historical data obtained from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea’s (ICES) database.;  Sample collection was performed with 10 dm3 Niskin bottles mounted on a FSI Integrated CTD rosette (Falmouth Scientific Inc., USA) with an additional Seapoint MOB optical sensor for determination of suspended load, a Seapoint fluorometer and a LICOR photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) sensor.;  Six hourly 10 m windspeeds and 2 m temperatures were obtained from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ERA-Interim data for the central North Sea in August 2010.; The North Sea is a particularly well-studied area thanks to its economic and strategic importance to Europe.;  We have investigated CTD and bottle data from this database for evidence of temporal changes in deepwater oxygen in the North Sea.;  Data were sorted to retain only measurements from June to September in the bottom third of the water column and binned into ICES grid squares in accordance with Berx and Hughes (2009), to produce data at a scale appropriate to many of the features of the North Sea system.;  In total, 332015 oxygen values were obtained for the Greater North Sea dating from 1900 to 2010.;  Although the majority of observations are located in the German Bight, the North-East Atlantic boundary and the Skagerrak outflow regions, sufficient data points remain in the central North Sea.;  In this paper, we loosely define the central North Sea as the offshore region situated between 56 and 58N.;  This effectively limits the analysis to the BML of the stratified North Sea, with the exception of the unstratified Pentland Firth.; In order to map spatial change, the original data selection criterion was used; measurements from the bottom third of the water column from the entire North Sea were kept, hence allowing analysis of trends in the generally mixed southern North Sea.;  Away from the influence of fresh water inputs (e.g. in the central North Sea) the difference in temperature between the surface mixed layer (SML) and BML provides a proxy for stratification.;  We observed a very strong temperature-driven stratification (10 °C difference between the SML and the BML) in the central North Sea (Fig. 3h) with a maximum density difference of 2 kg m−3 between the BML and SML (Fig. 2).;  In the offshore northern North Sea, stratification weakened to a 1.5 kg m−3 difference between both layers (7 °C temperature difference between the BML and SML) as bottom waters warmed (Fig. 2).;  Both the southern North Sea and the Scottish coast as far south as the Forth estuary were well mixed with stratification reducing gradually to a generally mixed water column as depth decreases (Figs. 2, ​,33h).;  A tongue of more saline water was observed coming from the Atlantic, following the central North Sea currents and reaching the Dogger Bank region.;  The rest of the North Sea surface water was at saturation concentration (circa 230 μmol dm−3 depending on temperature).;  Shallow waters not subject to stratification because of tidal mixing (i.e. the southern North Sea; Simpson et al. 1977) were saturated throughout the entire water column (around 210 μmol dm−3).;  The major mass of oxygen depleted water (65 % saturation, Fig. 3g) was located in the central North Sea, spanning from the south-east of Scotland towards the southern tip of Norway but stopping where the stratification increased due to the Skagerrak outflow (located between 56 and 58N).; Figure 5 displays a 5-yearly 11-year running mean of summer temperature, oxygen concentration and oxygen saturation of the BML in the stratified North Sea.;  These three time-series show no clear trends in oxygen concentration, oxygen saturation or temperature in bottom waters of the stratified North Sea up to 1990.; 5-yearly values of an 11-year running mean of a summer BML temperature (°C), b oxygen concentration (μmol dm−3) and c oxygen saturation (%) in the stratified central North Sea, subdivided into ICES grid squares (Fig. 6).; ICES data used in this study (Figs. 5, ​,6)6) show that prior to 1990, oxygen saturation in bottom waters of the northern North Sea (north of 58N) was typically 85–95 %, with elevated oxygen saturations (100 %) in the coastal regions of the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Germany and Denmark (Fig. 6a).;  A few isolated ICES squares also show low oxygen saturations in the northern North Sea.; Figure 6c suggests a decrease in oxygen saturation in the central and eastern North Sea after 1990, and increased oxygen saturation in Channel waters, the German Bight and the United Kingdom coastal waters.; A general increase in bottom water temperatures is visible across the greater North Sea (Fig. 6d).;  This 2 °C increase is uniform across the majority of the North Sea.;  Shelf seas such as the North Sea function differently to upwelling regions and resemble areas such as the Gulf of Mexico and the Baltic Sea more closely.;  This sets the central North Sea apart from regions such as the Baltic.; In this study, both increases and decreases of oxygen saturation were visible in bottom waters of different regions across the North Sea after 1990.;  This indicates that the North Sea summer oxygen depletion around the ND and OG sites is not a recent phenomenon but its intensity has been greatly affected in recent years.;  In the central North Sea, stratification is necessary for the occurrence of oxygen depletion (defined as the decrease of oxygen saturation) at depth, whereas a mixed water column may promote saturation.;  Increased nutrient loading in the North Sea would affect planktonic community structure and primary productivity and may contribute to the observed oxygen distribution (Jickells 1998), although other factors also influence the distribution and long-term changes in phytoplankton community in this region (Eppley 1972; Reid et al. 1990; McQuatters-Gollop et al. 2007).; Results from the August 2010 survey show the same oxygen saturation distribution as the ICES data and highlight two areas showing summer oxygen depletion: the OG and the central North Sea.;  They were the most strongly stratified regions of the North Sea in 2010 outside the fresh water inflow from the Skagerrak (Fig. 3d), emphasising the importance of the sequestration in the BML.;  The DC reduces in intensity as it enters the central North Sea (Dooley 1974).; One of the main difficulties in surveys of regions as large as the North Sea is differentiating between spatial and temporal variations.; To fully assess the extent of oxygen depletion in the North Sea in the summer of 2010, we must estimate depletion until the breakdown of the stratification.; It is particularly difficult to assess the evolution of oxygen saturation at depth due to the sparsity of data available in the North Sea.;  Nevertheless, the results of the hydrographic survey of the North Sea performed in August 2010 are consistent with the recent and historical observations of dissolved oxygen during the summer stratified period.;  Greenwood et al. (2010) began quantifying the oxygen depletion in the central North Sea, but more studies are required to clarify the drivers behind this phenomenon.;  Temperature, salinity, pressure and oxygen concentration data for the historical analysis were obtained from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea Dataset on Ocean Hydrography (2011).",Sea,chlorophyll,,up

secondly to assess the evolution of summer oxygen depletion in the North Sea over the past century using historical data obtained from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea’s (ICES) database.;  Sample collection was performed with 10 dm3 Niskin bottles mounted on a FSI Integrated CTD rosette (Falmouth Scientific Inc., USA) with an additional Seapoint MOB optical sensor for determination of suspended load, a Seapoint fluorometer and a LICOR photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) sensor.;  Six hourly 10 m windspeeds and 2 m temperatures were obtained from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ERA-Interim data for the central North Sea in August 2010.; The North Sea is a particularly well-studied area thanks to its economic and strategic importance to Europe.;  We have investigated CTD and bottle data from this database for evidence of temporal changes in deepwater oxygen in the North Sea.;  Data were sorted to retain only measurements from June to September in the bottom third of the water column and binned into ICES grid squares in accordance with Berx and Hughes (2009), to produce data at a scale appropriate to many of the features of the North Sea system.;  In total, 332015 oxygen values were obtained for the Greater North Sea dating from 1900 to 2010.;  Although the majority of observations are located in the German Bight, the North-East Atlantic boundary and the Skagerrak outflow regions, sufficient data points remain in the central North Sea.;  In this paper, we loosely define the central North Sea as the offshore region situated between 56 and 58N.;  This effectively limits the analysis to the BML of the stratified North Sea, with the exception of the unstratified Pentland Firth.; In order to map spatial change, the original data selection criterion was used; measurements from the bottom third of the water column from the entire North Sea were kept, hence allowing analysis of trends in the generally mixed southern North Sea.;  Away from the influence of fresh water inputs (e.g. in the central North Sea) the difference in temperature between the surface mixed layer (SML) and BML provides a proxy for stratification.;  We observed a very strong temperature-driven stratification (10 °C difference between the SML and the BML) in the central North Sea (Fig. 3h) with a maximum density difference of 2 kg m−3 between the BML and SML (Fig. 2).;  In the offshore northern North Sea, stratification weakened to a 1.5 kg m−3 difference between both layers (7 °C temperature difference between the BML and SML) as bottom waters warmed (Fig. 2).;  Both the southern North Sea and the Scottish coast as far south as the Forth estuary were well mixed with stratification reducing gradually to a generally mixed water column as depth decreases (Figs. 2, ​,33h).;  A tongue of more saline water was observed coming from the Atlantic, following the central North Sea currents and reaching the Dogger Bank region.;  The rest of the North Sea surface water was at saturation concentration (circa 230 μmol dm−3 depending on temperature).;  Shallow waters not subject to stratification because of tidal mixing (i.e. the southern North Sea; Simpson et al. 1977) were saturated throughout the entire water column (around 210 μmol dm−3).;  The major mass of oxygen depleted water (65 % saturation, Fig. 3g) was located in the central North Sea, spanning from the south-east of Scotland towards the southern tip of Norway but stopping where the stratification increased due to the Skagerrak outflow (located between 56 and 58N).; Figure 5 displays a 5-yearly 11-year running mean of summer temperature, oxygen concentration and oxygen saturation of the BML in the stratified North Sea.;  These three time-series show no clear trends in oxygen concentration, oxygen saturation or temperature in bottom waters of the stratified North Sea up to 1990.; 5-yearly values of an 11-year running mean of a summer BML temperature (°C), b oxygen concentration (μmol dm−3) and c oxygen saturation (%) in the stratified central North Sea, subdivided into ICES grid squares (Fig. 6).; ICES data used in this study (Figs. 5, ​,6)6) show that prior to 1990, oxygen saturation in bottom waters of the northern North Sea (north of 58N) was typically 85–95 %, with elevated oxygen saturations (100 %) in the coastal regions of the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Germany and Denmark (Fig. 6a).;  A few isolated ICES squares also show low oxygen saturations in the northern North Sea.; Figure 6c suggests a decrease in oxygen saturation in the central and eastern North Sea after 1990, and increased oxygen saturation in Channel waters, the German Bight and the United Kingdom coastal waters.; A general increase in bottom water temperatures is visible across the greater North Sea (Fig. 6d).;  This 2 °C increase is uniform across the majority of the North Sea.;  Shelf seas such as the North Sea function differently to upwelling regions and resemble areas such as the Gulf of Mexico and the Baltic Sea more closely.;  This sets the central North Sea apart from regions such as the Baltic.; In this study, both increases and decreases of oxygen saturation were visible in bottom waters of different regions across the North Sea after 1990.;  This indicates that the North Sea summer oxygen depletion around the ND and OG sites is not a recent phenomenon but its intensity has been greatly affected in recent years.;  In the central North Sea, stratification is necessary for the occurrence of oxygen depletion (defined as the decrease of oxygen saturation) at depth, whereas a mixed water column may promote saturation.;  Increased nutrient loading in the North Sea would affect planktonic community structure and primary productivity and may contribute to the observed oxygen distribution (Jickells 1998), although other factors also influence the distribution and long-term changes in phytoplankton community in this region (Eppley 1972; Reid et al. 1990; McQuatters-Gollop et al. 2007).; Results from the August 2010 survey show the same oxygen saturation distribution as the ICES data and highlight two areas showing summer oxygen depletion: the OG and the central North Sea.;  They were the most strongly stratified regions of the North Sea in 2010 outside the fresh water inflow from the Skagerrak (Fig. 3d), emphasising the importance of the sequestration in the BML.;  The DC reduces in intensity as it enters the central North Sea (Dooley 1974).; One of the main difficulties in surveys of regions as large as the North Sea is differentiating between spatial and temporal variations.; To fully assess the extent of oxygen depletion in the North Sea in the summer of 2010, we must estimate depletion until the breakdown of the stratification.; It is particularly difficult to assess the evolution of oxygen saturation at depth due to the sparsity of data available in the North Sea.;  Nevertheless, the results of the hydrographic survey of the North Sea performed in August 2010 are consistent with the recent and historical observations of dissolved oxygen during the summer stratified period.;  Greenwood et al. (2010) began quantifying the oxygen depletion in the central North Sea, but more studies are required to clarify the drivers behind this phenomenon.;  Temperature, salinity, pressure and oxygen concentration data for the historical analysis were obtained from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea Dataset on Ocean Hydrography (2011).",Sea,oxygen,,up

The Black Sea and the Benguela upwelling system off the Atlantic coast of Namibia are both represent organic carbon-rich marine environments.;  The Black Sea is the largest anoxic seawater basin on earth.;  Only few microbiological data are published for subsurface sediments of the Black Sea and the Benguela upwelling system (Leloup et al., 2007; Schäfer et al., 2007; Blazejak and Schippers, 2010, 2011).; In this study, the quantitative microbial community composition at six marine sediment stations from the Black Sea and in the Benguela upwelling area off Namibia at various sediment depths up to 10 m below seafloor (mbsf) was analyzed using total cell counting, CARD–FISH for the quantification of living Bacteria and Archaea, and 12 different Q-PCR assays for the quantification of particular phylogenetic or functional groups.;  The M72-5 R/V Meteor cruise to the Black Sea took place in May/June 2007 (Figure ​(Figure1).1).;  The sampled Black Sea sediments were permanently anoxic due to the overlaying anoxic water column.; Black Sea sediment stations of the cruise M72-5 analyzed in this study.;

The quantitative distribution of the microorganisms at the three stations along the transect course of the Benguela upwelling area (Figure ​(Figure4)4) was more heterogeneous than for the three Black Sea stations.;  Like for the Black Sea stations, the total cell counts sharply declined within the first 1 mbsf, and slightly decreased further below at the stations 3 and 8.;  In contrast to the CARD–FISH data, Archaea were found in similar copy numbers compared with the Bacteria at all three stations (as for the Black Sea results).; As found in the Black Sea sediments, the 16S rRNA gene copy numbers of the bacterial candidate division JS-1 and the classes Anaerolineae and Caldilineae of the phylum Chloroflexi as well as those of the Crenarchaeota occurred in similar numbers of 106 to 109 copies/mL than the 16S rRNA gene copy numbers of Prokaryotes, Bacteria, and Archaea.;  In contrast to the Black Sea sediments, both mcrA assays 1 and 2 of methanogens provided successful gene amplification, and mcrA and cbbL occurred not only in the near-surface sediment but also in the deeper subsurface sediment.; Microbial communities in the subsurface marine sediments of the Black Sea and the Benguela upwelling area off Namibia have been analyzed.;  A similar high abundance of prokaryotes analyzed by the same methods has been detected in organic carbon-rich sediments of the Peru margin (ODP Leg 201, D’Hondt et al., 2004; Schippers et al., 2005; Inagaki et al., 2006), gas-hydrate bearing sediments from the Cascadia margin (ODP Leg 204; Inagaki et al., 2006), northeast Pacific ridge-flank sediments (IODP Exp. 301; Engelen et al., 2008), tidal flat sediments of the North Sea (Wilms et al., 2007), and sediments off Sumatra (Schippers et al., 2010).;  Less organic carbon-rich marine sediments exhibited, as expected, a lower abundance of prokaryotes as shown for the equatorial Pacific (ODP Leg 201; D’Hondt et al., 2004; Schippers et al., 2005), the Porcupine Seabight (IODP Exp. 307; Webster et al., 2009), and the Gulf of Mexico (IODP Exp. 308; Nunoura et al., 2009).;  However, in the sapropel layer at 8–9 mbsf of the Black Sea station 22, the cell as well as the gene copy numbers again increased by more than an order of magnitude, explainable by the increased organic carbon content of the sapropel serving as substrate for the microorganisms.;  An almost equal abundance of Bacteria and Archaea has also been found for the Porcupine Seabight (IODP Exp. 307; Webster et al., 2009), the northeast Pacific ridge-flank (IODP Exp. 301; Engelen et al., 2008), and Sumatra forearc basins (Schippers et al., 2010).;

 In the near-surface anoxic and sulfidic sediments of the Black Sea the following eukaryotic groups were detected via DGGE and 18S rRNA gene sequencing: copepods, rotifers, haptophytes, dinoflagellates, and ciliates (Coolen and Shtereva, 2009).; As previously shown for the sediments off Sumatra, the Peru margin and the Black Sea station 20 (Blazejak and Schippers, 2010), the bacterial candidate division JS-1 and the classes Anaerolineae and Caldilineae of the phylum Chloroflexi were at least as highly abundant as the Bacteria for the other five stations of this study as well.;  This is consistent with our finding that this group could be quantified by Q-PCR in comparable (or higher) copy numbers than the Archaea in subsurface marine sediments of the Black Sea and the Benguela upwelling sediments.;

; The deep sea, the largest ecosystem on Earth and one of the least studied, harbours high biodiversity and provides a wealth of resources.;  The remoteness of the deep seafloor has promoted the disposal of residues and litter.;  Thus the challenges facing the deep sea are large and accelerating, providing a new imperative for the science community, industry and national and international organizations to work together to develop successful exploitation management and conservation of the deep-sea ecosystem.;  This paper provides scientific expert judgement and a semi-quantitative analysis of past, present and future impacts of human-related activities on global deep-sea habitats within three categories: disposal, exploitation and climate change.;  The analysis shows how, in recent decades, the most significant anthropogenic activities that affect the deep sea have evolved from mainly disposal (past) to exploitation (present).;  We predict that from now and into the future, increases in atmospheric CO2 and facets and consequences of climate change will have the most impact on deep-sea habitats and their fauna.;  We identify deep-sea ecosystems we believe are at higher risk from human impacts in the near future: benthic communities on sedimentary upper slopes, cold-water corals, canyon benthic communities and seamount pelagic and benthic communities.; Deep-sea exploration began a little over 150 years ago, initially promoted by the 19th century debates on whether life occurred at depths below 300 m [1].The deep sea is considered to start at about 200 m depth, at the shelf break, where a clear change of fauna from shallow to deep water is observed [2]. The waters deeper than 200 m form the largest environment on Earth with a volume of 1368×106 km3 covering an area of 360 million km2, equivalent to about 50% of the surface of the Earth, and have an average depth of 3800 m, with a maximum depth of 10,924 m in the Mariana Trench.;  Although the first record of a deep-sea species, the ophiuroid Gorgonocephalus caputmedusae (Linnaeus, 1758) (as Astrophyton linckii, Müller & Troschel, 1842), was provided by Sir John Ross in 1818 while sounding at 1600 m in the Northwest Passage [3], robust evidence of deep-sea fauna accumulated only from 1850.;  This expedition opened a period of national deep-sea exploration that culminated in the Galathea expedition of 1950–1952, which showed that animals live at all depths, including the deepest parts of the ocean.;  At the end of this period of pioneering exploration, our understanding of the deep ocean was one of low biodiversity, no primary production, no seasonality and a uniformly cold, food-poor, dark, tranquil and invariant environment.;  It was with this scientific framework that the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) was written and signed in 1972, and the deep-sea floor of the high-seas was deemed exploitable for biological resources and sea-floor minerals.;  In the late 1960s and 1970s, increasingly sophisticated sampling methodologies with the ability to collect quantitative samples of macrofauna demonstrated that the deep sea was much more biologically diverse than originally thought.;  In 1967, Hessler and Sanders [4] documented remarkable levels of species diversity in the deep sea, with up to 365 species in a single macrofaunal sample.;  Subsequently, in 1992, Grassle and Maciolek [5] estimated that the entire deep sea might contain up to 10 million species of small invertebrates, mostly polychaetes, peracarid crustaceans and molluscs (twice as many as the estimated 5 million species in rain forests [6]).;  This estimate generated considerable debate concerning the order of magnitude of species diversity [7], [8], but the general concept that the deep sea was a highly species-rich environment was now supported by intensive sampling efforts and rigorous statistical analyses [9]. Although deep-sea species have not proven to be eurytopic (i.e. able to adapt to a wide range of environmental conditions), they may show no more stenotopy (i.e. ability to adapt only to a narrow range of environmental conditions) than is found in shallow water [10]. Thus, regional diversity could be lower than originally anticipated and the most recent estimates of total deep-sea diversity of macrofauna are considerably less than 10 million species [11]. However, further detailed sampling and analyses are necessary to describe regional diversity patterns accurately.; The late 1970s and 1980s gave rise to many exciting discoveries in the deep sea, including hydrothermal vents [12], cold seeps [13], [14], chemosynthetic ecosystems created on whale falls [15], benthic storms [16] and seasonality [17]–[19]. With the greater use of remote techniques such as multibeam swath bathymetry and seafloor imagery, habitat heterogeneity in parts of the deep sea was shown to be high.;  This heterogeneity, taken together with the vast areas of the deep sea has reinforced the concept of high biodiversity [20]–[23].; By the end of the 20th Century, the deep sea was recognised as the largest environment on Earth containing numerous sub-habitats, with unique abiotic and biological characteristics and supporting a particularly high biodiversity [24]. However, the deep sea has remained rather remote from public consciousness and the first exploitations and anthropogenic activities did not have any major social impact.;  The deep sea was (and still is) perceived as a service provider at two levels: (1) it served as a convenient site for disposal of waste, especially where land options were not politically and “ethically” attractive and (2) it was seen as a source of potential mineral and biological wealth over which there was no national jurisdiction.;  In the last decades, decreases in the amount of land-based and coastal resources combined with rapid technological development has driven increased interest in the exploration and exploitation of deep-sea goods and services, to advance at a faster pace than the acquisition of scientific knowledge of the ecosystems [25]–[27]. Evidence of this is found, for example, in the boom and bust cycle of many deep-sea fisheries in the 1970s–1980s [e.g. 28], [29], the disposal of sewage waste in deep water in the 1980s [30] and the dumping of chemical wastes and munitions [25]. Furthermore, human activities on land have promulgated a third and perhaps more dangerous level of impact: increasing atmospheric CO2 emissions that have resulted in climate change [31] – including the warming of the ocean, stratification and the generation and expansion of hypoxia – and ocean acidification [32]. A study by Halpern et al. [33] indicates that no area in the ocean is completely unaffected by anthropogenic impact and that most areas (41%) are affected by multiple drivers.;  Their model shows that coastal ecosystems receive the greatest cumulative impact, while polar regions and deep waters seem to be the least impacted [33]. Previous studies have reviewed different aspects of anthropogenic impact in the deep sea [25], [29], [34], [35], but to date little information is available on the direct and long-term effects of human activities in bathyal and abyssal ecosystems.; In this paper, we assess past, present and future impacts of human-related activities on deep-sea habitats and their communities, from disposal, through exploitation to climate change (including ocean acidification) using a semi-quantitative analytical approach.;  Studies on effects of anthropogenic impact on deep-sea habitats are still limited and often conducted at local or, at most, regional scales.;  We acknowledge this lack of global data and identify gaps that need urgent attention if we are to understand the resilience of deep-sea communities to anthropogenic stressors.;  This has proved difficult in the deep sea, as impact has often taken place before any baseline survey and the limited evidence to date suggests that the nature and extent of impacts can be variable [25], [29]. As a result, we have relied on the authors' collective and extensive experience of the deep-sea ecosystem together with the published literature, to provide a semi-quantitative scale of anthropogenic impact assessment.;  During the course of a Census of Marine Life SYNDEEP workshop (Sept. 2008), a group of 23 deep-sea researchers (see legend in Table S1) developed a scoring system to grade the effect of 28 major anthropogenic impacts grouped in 3 main categories (Table 1) on 12 deep-sea habitats (see description of habitats below).;  These discussions reflect knowledge of the current literature and the experience and judgment of the researchers involved in this study.;  After the workshop, the draft table was circulated amongst all researchers for any further input and to achieve a final check and final consensus on the scores.;  We recognize that this scoring system is subjective, but in the absence of global quantitative data, it gives some indication of future impacts on the ecosystem services provided by the deep sea.; We have conducted this analysis by dividing the deep sea according to the type of habitat.; Anthropogenic impacts are seen, intuitively, as detrimental to deep-sea organisms at various scales.;  An important factor affecting our capacity to score impact in the deep sea is our limited knowledge on biodiversity and ecosystem function for some habitats.;  These tables are intended to be modified as we understand more precisely anthropogenic impact on the deep sea.; The deep seafloor is, for most people, out of sight and therefore, often, out of mind.;  Although dumping waste and litter into the sea is now legally banned, the problem persists because of the historical accumulation of marine litter in all the world's oceans.; The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) defines marine litter as “any persistent, manufactured or processed solid material discarded, disposed of or abandoned in the marine and coastal environment”. The first intended (as opposed to accidental) disposal of waste in the deep sea predates scientific interest in this environment.;  In a survey on the nodule-free abyssal plain in the northeastern Atlantic, Kidd and Huggett [37] showed that clinker formed more than 50% of the hard substratum (the other being glacial drop stones) and that this clinker formed a suitable attachment point for the anemone Phelliactis robusta
[38] (Figure 1A), although it appears toxic to other deep-sea species.;  Highly erosive deep-sea storms, which may affect 10% of the deep-sea floor, can transport laterally sediment loads along with benthic fauna [42]. It is reasonable to assume that these storms may also transport refuse to seafloor depressions, which can serve as debris traps.;  Wood construction material and scraps of wood, bark, macrophytes and fruit that provide both habitat and nourishment to marine organisms [44]–[46] have been documented in deep-sea trawl samples periodically for at least three decades [47]–[49]. No definitive quantitative documentation, however, yet allows generalizations to be made about human generated refuse in deep-sea environments [50]. Litter is observed in almost all scientific seafloor surveys using video (e.g. remote operated vehicles, ROVs) and trawls.;  However, the amount of litter varies in different regions and no dedicated studies have been conducted to estimate the extent of litter accumulation in deep-sea habitats or to assess the effect of different litter types in the habitat and its effects on the fauna [51]. The most common litter types found on the deep–sea floor in the Mediterranean and northeastern Atlantic are soft plastic (e.g. bags), hard plastic (e.g. bottles, containers), glass and metal (e.g. tins, cans) (Figure 2A–C) [24], [52]–[55]. As part of a project investigating the biodiversity of bathyal and abyssal Mediterranean environments, 20 trawls were conducted using an otter trawl, covering a total area of 1 km2.;  Miyake et al [55] have used the JAMSTEC online deep-sea image database to conduct analysis of the occurrence and type of marine litter in the deep waters off Japan.;  Plastics are found everywhere, from land to the oceans, from the coast to the deep sea [59]. Although some types of litter are recognizable, there is accumulating evidence that “mermaids' tears” (5 mm in diameter) and microplastics (microscopic sand grain-sized particles of eroded plastic) are becoming more common in the world oceans, including the deep sea [60], [61]. While the standing stock of mega- and macro-plastics in the oceans seems to be relatively stable, the size of plastic debris is decreasing and the amount of microplastics is increasing as a function of larger plastic breakdown and an increase in primary microplastics.;  In recent years, the use of biodegradable materials was proposed as a solution to the accumulation of plastics in the environment, but in some cases, the degradable material merely disintegrated into smaller pieces that are not degradable [58]. Little is known, however, of the true effect of these particles on the environment and the fauna [62]. Several studies have shown that effects such as ingestion by invertebrates could facilitate the transport of hydrophobic contaminants [63] and the release of potentially toxic bisphenol A and PS oligomers during plastic breakdown, which can disrupt hormonal functioning and reproductive systems in the fauna [64]. Studies in the deep sea are practically nonexistent and an urgent assessment of the impact of microplastics on deep-sea fauna is needed along with the development of methods to quantify and monitor their abundance and to identify potential sources and sinks of this debris.; Scientific research using moorings, submersibles and ROVs also contributes to deep-sea litter by the dropping of ballast weights (often solid plates or pellets of mild steel), although these contributions are small in relation to other sources of litter.;  On dives where there may be rock sampling, up to 65 kg of descent weight may be discarded at the seabed per dive (D.;  In addition, instruments such as current-meter moorings, markers and other scientific tools are placed on the seabed and recovered after variable periods.;  Furthermore, a small proportion of these instruments are unrecoverable and lost at sea.;  Impacts of litter on deep-sea habitats and fauna may include suffocation of animals from plastics, release of toxic chemicals, propagation of invasive species, physical damage to sessile fauna such as cold-water corals from discarded fishing gear, and ghost fishing from lost/discarded nets [59], [66], but these impacts are poorly quantified on a large geographical scale.;  The increasing evidence of continuous accumulation of litter has been recognised by the UNEP-Regional Seas initiative, which identified the need for further research on the impacts of marine litter in coastal areas [41] and with an increasing interest in deep-sea habitats (Gjerde, pers. com.).;  Current international multidisciplinary research programmes, such as the EU funded HERMIONE (Hotspot Ecosystem Research and Man's Impact on European Seas) project that investigates deep-sea ecosystem function and its contribution to production of goods and services, are incorporating studies of litter accumulation and impact.; An example of significant but localized waste was the Deep Water dumpsite 106 at bathyal depths (about 2500 m) (sedimentary slopes) along the eastern seaboard of the United States.;  Van Dover et al. [30] demonstrated incorporation of sewage-derived organic matter by benthic deposit feeders based on altered stable isotope ratios of megafauna, whilst Bothner et al. [71] showed that there were clear faunal changes at the seabed.;  Following the cessation of dumping in 1992 there was an immediate improvement in local conditions, although indicators of pollution were still measurable at 75 km down-stream [25]. There is no known dumping of sewage or dredge spoil in the deep sea at present or planned for the future, although the option has been discussed for decades [72].; In addition, deep-sea disposal of terrestrial mine tailings is a future problem for island nations, such as Papua New Guinea, where access to deep water via pipelines is feasible.;  In the early years of fishing for orange roughy off New Zealand, catches were often too large to be hauled back on board, and nets would burst spilling tens of tonnes of fish [e.g. 73], [74]. Seabird populations can benefit substantially from foraging on offal and discards [e.g. 75], [76] but the attraction of both seabirds and marine mammals (in particular seals) has become an important issue worldwide.;  This is an on-going problem for responsible fisheries, leading to devices such as bird-scarers, seal-exclusion grids, and regulations governing the discharge of offal.;  Offal from a New Zealand fishery for hoki (Macruronus novaezelandiae) was reported to reduce oxygen levels at 800 m depth [77] and possibly alter benthic community composition [78]. However, management of offal can minimise upper ocean impacts with careful disposal (e.g., only at night and away from sensitive habitat such as seamounts), using mincers to grind up the heads and bodies into small pieces, or rendering the waste into fishmeal.; Livestock transported on ships may die while at sea.;  When this occurs, the dead animals might be dumped into the ocean, contributing occasional large pulses of organic material to the seafloor, similar to other natural large-organic falls (e.g. whale falls, kelp falls).;  Whale falls deliver large pulses of organic material (40-tonne whale carcass as the typical amount) [79] to the seafloor, providing significant inputs of organic matter to the normally food-limited deep sea and being most prevalent along migration corridors of the dominant large whale species [80]. For example, hundreds of grey whales sink to the seafloor annually within an area of 8×105 km2 along the eastern Pacific [15]. This density was similar or probably larger in the 19th century, as depicted in the whale charts published by M.F.;  Maury [81], and whaling is predicted to have restricted the distribution of whale-fall colonists [82], [83]. Most animals that die at sea while being shipped die of scabby-mouth [84] and salmonellosis [85], and ‘slaughter at sea’ sometimes occurs [85]. Some vessels that carry large numbers of livestock are equipped with a macerator to grind animals that die on route, and then channel the remains straight into the sea [86]. In addition, there is evidence of diseased animals being killed and their carcasses being burnt and sunk at sea.;  Another 10,000 sheep were dumped from a ship en route between New Zealand and Saudi Arabia in 1990, and 40,000 off the coast of southern Australia [86], [87]. In July 2002, about 270,400 sheep died and where dumped at sea while en route to the Middle East [88]. The Keniry Report (2003) [85] has acknowledged that with about 300,000 sheep and 10,000 cattle being transported by sea at any time, the potential dumping of deceased animals could create a significant environmental perturbation.;  No evidence of disease transmission from dead livestock to deep-sea communities has been evaluated or recorded to date.; There has been some intentional disposal of pharmaceuticals in the deep sea.;  Between 1973 and 1978, more than 387,000 tonnes of wastes were dumped in the trench (equivalent to 880 Boeing 747s) (http://deepseanews.com/2008/04/dumping-pharmaceutical-waste-in-the-deep-sea/).;  Pharmaceutical wastes are an important issue for environmental management as they are so widely used, although their impact in the deep sea is uncertain.; More controversial has been the disposal of radioactive waste in the deep sea.;  Anthropogenic radionuclides are often elevated in deep-sea sediment [96] and midwater organisms [97] but the discovery of radioactive elements in holothurians at 5000 m from weapons testing [98] was not readily explained until the understanding of vertical flux characteristics of surface-derived phytodetritus [99]. The disposal of radioactive waste has been much more difficult to monitor.;  Although there was an active programme in the 1980s to assess the feasibility and potential impacts of high-level radioactive waste disposal in the deep sea, political considerations stopped this programme and no intentional disposal of any radioactive waste occurs in the ocean today (Tables S1 and S2).; Chemical contamination of deep-sea sediments and their effect on the fauna is still mostly unstudied.;  Although few studies are available, the recent increased sophistication of chemical analyses since the 2000s has shown that chemicals are accumulating in deep-sea sediments, benthos and midwater fauna (Table S2) [29], [103], [104]. The major contaminants of concern are persistent organic pollutants, toxic metals (e.g.;  Some xenobiotics, such as synthetic organochlofoforides used in pesticides and plastics are resistant to degradation and deep-sea sediments have been suggested as the final accumulation site for these man-made pollutants [105]. Biochemical effects of xenobiotics (i.e., induction of cytochrome P450E that catalyzes transformation of foreign compounds) were first reported in rattail fish collected from depths greater than 1000 m [106], [107]. More recent work reinforces the view that organisms and sediments of the deep sea are global sinks for persistent semi-volatile contaminants [103], [104], with bioaccufmulation and enrichment in deep-sea organisms a consequence of consumption and recycling of pre-enriched organic matter as it sinks through the water column.;  The bioaccumufolation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons by amphipods in the deep Gulf of Mexico shows differences in the concentration of these compounds in the sediment and fauna, which suggest preferential uptake of certain compounds [68]. Hydrodynamics play a major role in the accumulation of chemical pollutants in deep-sea habitats.;  Overall, the impact of persistent organic pollutants in the deep sea would appear to be low at present (Table S2), mainly because of dilution.; Ships have been lost since humans first took to the sea.;  Between 1970 and 1990, the equivalent of 18 ships and 65,000 tons of shipping sank on the high seas (excluding coastal waters) per year [25]. Both world wars would have contributed considerably more than this in both merchant and military losses [35]. To illustrate the scale, in World War II, for example, during the battle of the Atlantic, more than 175 military ships were lost and more than 3500 merchant British ships (excluding other allies) were sunk, many of them in deep water [112] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Atlantic_(1939%E2%80%931945)#Outcomes).;  Colonisation of deep-sea wrecks is difficult to quantify.;  In addition to ships, some 10,000 containers are lost overboard from ships each year, mainly as a result of storms (http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2001/06/0619_seacargo.html).;  Although some may float for weeks, many will sink to the seafloor taking their cargo with them.;  Impacts might be negative locally where the wreck/structure physically affects the seabed, but a hard substratum can increase local habitat heterogeneity providing substratum for certain species.;  A significant problem resides in ships containing munitions, as well as in discarded munitions, which, through the corrosive effect of seawater can release chemical pollutants.;  OSPAR (Commission for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic) has mapped chemical warfare components in the northeastern Atlantic [116] and a pioneer study (RED COD) has been conducted in a warfare material dumping site in the Adriatic [117]. The RED COD project showed that, although neither chemical warfare agents nor TNT were identified in tissues of the fish analysed, biomarker analyses indicated a higher stress level, higher arsenic and mercury content and gill DNA damage in the fish specimens from the dumping site compared to the non-impacted areas [117]. Taking into consideration the extent of war material dump sites worldwide [117] and the interconnectivity of oceans through hydrodynamic dispersal of particles, it is imperative that detailed studies be conducted assess local, regional and global impact of such material in the deep sea.; With increasing international interest in climate change and the recognised increase in CO2 levels in the atmosphere, methods proposed for the long term disposal of greenhouse gases include both sub-seabed disposal and surface seabed disposal [118]. The principle underlying sub-seabed disposal is that carbon dioxide (like methane) forms a solid crystalline structure at appropriate temperature and pressure conditions [119] and thus the injection of CO2 into suitable seabed structures (including past and ongoing oil and gas reservoirs) should cause the CO2 to form hydrates and hence act as a long term depository of excess CO2.;  Sleipner has stored about one million tonnes of CO2 a year at a depth of 800–1000 m below the seafloor.;  There has been no evidence of leakage so far and multinational and multidisciplinary research projects are underway to assess the CO2 state, to investigate any potential impacts and to predict the long-term destiny of the CO2[120], [121]. This existing operation, and another in the Snøhvit gas field in the Barents Sea that stores 700,000 tonnes CO2 per year at depths of 320 m, are relatively small-scale when compared with proposed industrial scale CO2 disposal, which would store about 1000 times this amount.; A simpler and cheaper option that has been considered is the direct disposal of liquid CO2 onto the deep seabed, based on the principle that a gas hydrate will be generated on the seabed.;  However, small-scale experiments have shown that fish swimming into the CO2 plume are narcotised, although they recover as they drift out of the CO2 cloud [122]. Scavenging fish and amphipods appear able to detect and avoid toxic CO2 plumes released from hydrothermal vents at the seafloor [123], while some taxa have evolved tolerances at natural deep CO2 vents [124]. Experiments on the survival of meiobenthos exposed to small-scale patches of artificially emplaced liquid CO2 show that, immediately adjacent to the CO2, pH fell and meiofauna died, whereas at control sites about 40 m distant, pH was unaltered and no meiofauna died [125]–[128]. The experiments also assessed the survival of macrofauna and megafauna (i.e. gastropods, echinoids, holothurians, cephalopods and fish) during month-long exposure to elevated CO2 levels and concluded that disposal of human-generated CO2 in the deep sea will have variable, but generally negative effects on deep-sea ecosystems.;  In particular, industrial scale CO2 disposal has the potential to create a “scavenger” sink, attracting and killing ever larger numbers of deep-sea scavengers drawn to an accumulation of dead biomass within the influence of the disposal plume [123]. An in situ experiment at more than 3000 m depth off Central California provided evidence that exposure to CO2-rich seawater is stressful for some deep-sea fauna such as harpacticoid copepods [129]. A frequently considered method of CO2 disposal with an indirect effect on the seabed is the use of iron fertilisation in areas of high nutrient low chlorophyll, to encourage phytoplankton growth, causing CO2 drawdown, with the subsequent sequestration of carbon via phytodetrital flux at depth [130]. Concerns have been raised about accompanying oxygen depletion [131]. Although iron fertilisation looks attractive in theory [132], [133] and is generating commercial interest, the amount of surface production sequestered is in the same order of magnitude as normal downward particle flux and thus relatively low [134]. Nonetheless, profound changes in ecosystem goods, services and values of the deep sea can be expected as a consequence of dumping iron into the ocean [135]. Ocean fertilisation by artificial upwelling has also been suggested to reduce the accumulation of anthropogenic carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.; Whereas in the past the main threat to the deep sea was probably the disposal of waste solids and chemicals, as well as the cascading effects of overfishing in shallow water [137], new direct threats are appearing and increasing as a result of expanding technological capabilities that permit exploitation of biological, mineral and petrochemical resources.; Technological development and market demand have both exacerbated the increasing exploitation of high-seas deepwater fisheries and the need to identify effective means of regulation to protect those fisheries and their environment [138]. Until the mid 1900s, trawling was generally restricted to the continental shelf at depths less than 200 m.;  These factors led vessels to explore progressively deeper and more distant waters and new fishery resources [e.g. 28], [139], [140]. Fisheries on the upper continental slope and deep seamounts to depths of 1500 m expanded for species like pelagic armourhead (Pseudopentaceros wheeleri), orange roughy (Hoplostethus atlanticus), alfonsino (Beryx splendens), oreos (Pseudocyttus maculatus, Allocyttus niger) and grenadiers (Coryphaenoides rupestris), but almost none of these have proven sustainable [e.g. 28], [141], [142]. This deep-sea trawling has had an impact on fish populations down to 3100 m [143], as well as by-catch species [144]. Scientific knowledge of deep-sea fish populations has tended to lag behind fisheries development, and stock depletion often has occurred before the population dynamics of the exploited species were understood enough to be used to prevent stock collapse [e.g. 145]. Overfishing issues are particularly important in deep-sea species which are often long lived, with slow growth and delayed maturity [e.g. 146], making them poorly adapted to sustain heavy fishing pressure.; The effects of trawling on benthic habitat and communities can be severe in deeper waters, especially on the upper continental slope and seamounts [147]–[149]. On a global scale, most deep-sea bottom trawling happens on sedimentary slopes.;  In the OSPAR area (northeastern Atlantic), the spatial extent of bottom trawling is orders of magnitude greater than that of submarine cables, waste disposal and oil and gas exploitation [27]. Although the communities found at habitats such as seamounts, cold-water coral reefs and cold seeps may be more vulnerable than sediment-dwelling assemblages, the impacts of fishing on seamounts and cold seeps have rarely been assessed, with significant exceptions such as in New Zealand and Australian waters.;  Trawling effort can be intense, with hundreds, or even thousands, of tows repeatedly carried out on small seamounts or cold seeps [150], [151]. Heavy trawling can reduce the diversity and biomass of benthic invertebrates, especially framework-forming foundation species like cold-water corals [152], [153]. Recovery of cold-water assemblages from fishing disturbance occurs slowly, even after fishing has ceased for 5–10 years there have been no signs of faunal recovery [154], [155]. On the deep slope of the northwestern Mediterranean, trawling for the red shrimp Aristeus antennatus has taken place for the last six decades and is now reaching 900 m depth [156]. Recent biodiversity studies in this area suggest that there are significant differences in the community structure of fished and non-fished areas, with a decrease in sessile and fragile species such as corals, sponges and echinoderms on the impacted fished seafloor [24], [157]. Hence, as in shallow water, bottom trawling has a large impact on areas of deep slope and is greater still in rocky areas or seamounts where coral is frequently found at depths of about 1000 m (Figure 4A).;  This suggests that intense trawling in certain regions needs to be taken into consideration for canyon sediment dynamics and that the gravity flows generated can have major consequences (e.g. suffocation of cold-water corals) far from the trawled area [160]. A further issue with industrial fishing is the presence of lost or discarded nets on the seafloor, which are responsible for ghost fishing affecting the benthic and benthopelagic fauna passively for years (Figure 4B).; A, Part ",,,,

; The deep sea, the largest ecosystem on Earth and one of the least studied, harbours high biodiversity and provides a wealth of resources.;  The remoteness of the deep seafloor has promoted the disposal of residues and litter.;  Thus the challenges facing the deep sea are large and accelerating, providing a new imperative for the science community, industry and national and international organizations to work together to develop successful exploitation management and conservation of the deep-sea ecosystem.;  This paper provides scientific expert judgement and a semi-quantitative analysis of past, present and future impacts of human-related activities on global deep-sea habitats within three categories: disposal, exploitation and climate change.;  The analysis shows how, in recent decades, the most significant anthropogenic activities that affect the deep sea have evolved from mainly disposal (past) to exploitation (present).;  We predict that from now and into the future, increases in atmospheric CO2 and facets and consequences of climate change will have the most impact on deep-sea habitats and their fauna.;  We identify deep-sea ecosystems we believe are at higher risk from human impacts in the near future: benthic communities on sedimentary upper slopes, cold-water corals, canyon benthic communities and seamount pelagic and benthic communities.; Deep-sea exploration began a little over 150 years ago, initially promoted by the 19th century debates on whether life occurred at depths below 300 m [1].The deep sea is considered to start at about 200 m depth, at the shelf break, where a clear change of fauna from shallow to deep water is observed [2]. The waters deeper than 200 m form the largest environment on Earth with a volume of 1368×106 km3 covering an area of 360 million km2, equivalent to about 50% of the surface of the Earth, and have an average depth of 3800 m, with a maximum depth of 10,924 m in the Mariana Trench.;  Although the first record of a deep-sea species, the ophiuroid Gorgonocephalus caputmedusae (Linnaeus, 1758) (as Astrophyton linckii, Müller & Troschel, 1842), was provided by Sir John Ross in 1818 while sounding at 1600 m in the Northwest Passage [3], robust evidence of deep-sea fauna accumulated only from 1850.;  This expedition opened a period of national deep-sea exploration that culminated in the Galathea expedition of 1950–1952, which showed that animals live at all depths, including the deepest parts of the ocean.;  At the end of this period of pioneering exploration, our understanding of the deep ocean was one of low biodiversity, no primary production, no seasonality and a uniformly cold, food-poor, dark, tranquil and invariant environment.;  It was with this scientific framework that the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) was written and signed in 1972, and the deep-sea floor of the high-seas was deemed exploitable for biological resources and sea-floor minerals.;  In the late 1960s and 1970s, increasingly sophisticated sampling methodologies with the ability to collect quantitative samples of macrofauna demonstrated that the deep sea was much more biologically diverse than originally thought.;  In 1967, Hessler and Sanders [4] documented remarkable levels of species diversity in the deep sea, with up to 365 species in a single macrofaunal sample.;  Subsequently, in 1992, Grassle and Maciolek [5] estimated that the entire deep sea might contain up to 10 million species of small invertebrates, mostly polychaetes, peracarid crustaceans and molluscs (twice as many as the estimated 5 million species in rain forests [6]).;  This estimate generated considerable debate concerning the order of magnitude of species diversity [7], [8], but the general concept that the deep sea was a highly species-rich environment was now supported by intensive sampling efforts and rigorous statistical analyses [9]. Although deep-sea species have not proven to be eurytopic (i.e. able to adapt to a wide range of environmental conditions), they may show no more stenotopy (i.e. ability to adapt only to a narrow range of environmental conditions) than is found in shallow water [10]. Thus, regional diversity could be lower than originally anticipated and the most recent estimates of total deep-sea diversity of macrofauna are considerably less than 10 million species [11]. However, further detailed sampling and analyses are necessary to describe regional diversity patterns accurately.; The late 1970s and 1980s gave rise to many exciting discoveries in the deep sea, including hydrothermal vents [12], cold seeps [13], [14], chemosynthetic ecosystems created on whale falls [15], benthic storms [16] and seasonality [17]–[19]. With the greater use of remote techniques such as multibeam swath bathymetry and seafloor imagery, habitat heterogeneity in parts of the deep sea was shown to be high.;  This heterogeneity, taken together with the vast areas of the deep sea has reinforced the concept of high biodiversity [20]–[23].; By the end of the 20th Century, the deep sea was recognised as the largest environment on Earth containing numerous sub-habitats, with unique abiotic and biological characteristics and supporting a particularly high biodiversity [24]. However, the deep sea has remained rather remote from public consciousness and the first exploitations and anthropogenic activities did not have any major social impact.;  The deep sea was (and still is) perceived as a service provider at two levels: (1) it served as a convenient site for disposal of waste, especially where land options were not politically and “ethically” attractive and (2) it was seen as a source of potential mineral and biological wealth over which there was no national jurisdiction.;  In the last decades, decreases in the amount of land-based and coastal resources combined with rapid technological development has driven increased interest in the exploration and exploitation of deep-sea goods and services, to advance at a faster pace than the acquisition of scientific knowledge of the ecosystems [25]–[27]. Evidence of this is found, for example, in the boom and bust cycle of many deep-sea fisheries in the 1970s–1980s [e.g. 28], [29], the disposal of sewage waste in deep water in the 1980s [30] and the dumping of chemical wastes and munitions [25]. Furthermore, human activities on land have promulgated a third and perhaps more dangerous level of impact: increasing atmospheric CO2 emissions that have resulted in climate change [31] – including the warming of the ocean, stratification and the generation and expansion of hypoxia – and ocean acidification [32]. A study by Halpern et al. [33] indicates that no area in the ocean is completely unaffected by anthropogenic impact and that most areas (41%) are affected by multiple drivers.;  Their model shows that coastal ecosystems receive the greatest cumulative impact, while polar regions and deep waters seem to be the least impacted [33]. Previous studies have reviewed different aspects of anthropogenic impact in the deep sea [25], [29], [34], [35], but to date little information is available on the direct and long-term effects of human activities in bathyal and abyssal ecosystems.; In this paper, we assess past, present and future impacts of human-related activities on deep-sea habitats and their communities, from disposal, through exploitation to climate change (including ocean acidification) using a semi-quantitative analytical approach.;  Studies on effects of anthropogenic impact on deep-sea habitats are still limited and often conducted at local or, at most, regional scales.;  We acknowledge this lack of global data and identify gaps that need urgent attention if we are to understand the resilience of deep-sea communities to anthropogenic stressors.;  This has proved difficult in the deep sea, as impact has often taken place before any baseline survey and the limited evidence to date suggests that the nature and extent of impacts can be variable [25], [29]. As a result, we have relied on the authors' collective and extensive experience of the deep-sea ecosystem together with the published literature, to provide a semi-quantitative scale of anthropogenic impact assessment.;  During the course of a Census of Marine Life SYNDEEP workshop (Sept. 2008), a group of 23 deep-sea researchers (see legend in Table S1) developed a scoring system to grade the effect of 28 major anthropogenic impacts grouped in 3 main categories (Table 1) on 12 deep-sea habitats (see description of habitats below).;  These discussions reflect knowledge of the current literature and the experience and judgment of the researchers involved in this study.;  After the workshop, the draft table was circulated amongst all researchers for any further input and to achieve a final check and final consensus on the scores.;  We recognize that this scoring system is subjective, but in the absence of global quantitative data, it gives some indication of future impacts on the ecosystem services provided by the deep sea.; We have conducted this analysis by dividing the deep sea according to the type of habitat.; Anthropogenic impacts are seen, intuitively, as detrimental to deep-sea organisms at various scales.;  An important factor affecting our capacity to score impact in the deep sea is our limited knowledge on biodiversity and ecosystem function for some habitats.;  These tables are intended to be modified as we understand more precisely anthropogenic impact on the deep sea.; The deep seafloor is, for most people, out of sight and therefore, often, out of mind.;  Although dumping waste and litter into the sea is now legally banned, the problem persists because of the historical accumulation of marine litter in all the world's oceans.; The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) defines marine litter as “any persistent, manufactured or processed solid material discarded, disposed of or abandoned in the marine and coastal environment”. The first intended (as opposed to accidental) disposal of waste in the deep sea predates scientific interest in this environment.;  In a survey on the nodule-free abyssal plain in the northeastern Atlantic, Kidd and Huggett [37] showed that clinker formed more than 50% of the hard substratum (the other being glacial drop stones) and that this clinker formed a suitable attachment point for the anemone Phelliactis robusta
[38] (Figure 1A), although it appears toxic to other deep-sea species.;  Highly erosive deep-sea storms, which may affect 10% of the deep-sea floor, can transport laterally sediment loads along with benthic fauna [42]. It is reasonable to assume that these storms may also transport refuse to seafloor depressions, which can serve as debris traps.;  Wood construction material and scraps of wood, bark, macrophytes and fruit that provide both habitat and nourishment to marine organisms [44]–[46] have been documented in deep-sea trawl samples periodically for at least three decades [47]–[49]. No definitive quantitative documentation, however, yet allows generalizations to be made about human generated refuse in deep-sea environments [50]. Litter is observed in almost all scientific seafloor surveys using video (e.g. remote operated vehicles, ROVs) and trawls.;  However, the amount of litter varies in different regions and no dedicated studies have been conducted to estimate the extent of litter accumulation in deep-sea habitats or to assess the effect of different litter types in the habitat and its effects on the fauna [51]. The most common litter types found on the deep–sea floor in the Mediterranean and northeastern Atlantic are soft plastic (e.g. bags), hard plastic (e.g. bottles, containers), glass and metal (e.g. tins, cans) (Figure 2A–C) [24], [52]–[55]. As part of a project investigating the biodiversity of bathyal and abyssal Mediterranean environments, 20 trawls were conducted using an otter trawl, covering a total area of 1 km2.;  Miyake et al [55] have used the JAMSTEC online deep-sea image database to conduct analysis of the occurrence and type of marine litter in the deep waters off Japan.;  Plastics are found everywhere, from land to the oceans, from the coast to the deep sea [59]. Although some types of litter are recognizable, there is accumulating evidence that “mermaids' tears” (5 mm in diameter) and microplastics (microscopic sand grain-sized particles of eroded plastic) are becoming more common in the world oceans, including the deep sea [60], [61]. While the standing stock of mega- and macro-plastics in the oceans seems to be relatively stable, the size of plastic debris is decreasing and the amount of microplastics is increasing as a function of larger plastic breakdown and an increase in primary microplastics.;  In recent years, the use of biodegradable materials was proposed as a solution to the accumulation of plastics in the environment, but in some cases, the degradable material merely disintegrated into smaller pieces that are not degradable [58]. Little is known, however, of the true effect of these particles on the environment and the fauna [62]. Several studies have shown that effects such as ingestion by invertebrates could facilitate the transport of hydrophobic contaminants [63] and the release of potentially toxic bisphenol A and PS oligomers during plastic breakdown, which can disrupt hormonal functioning and reproductive systems in the fauna [64]. Studies in the deep sea are practically nonexistent and an urgent assessment of the impact of microplastics on deep-sea fauna is needed along with the development of methods to quantify and monitor their abundance and to identify potential sources and sinks of this debris.; Scientific research using moorings, submersibles and ROVs also contributes to deep-sea litter by the dropping of ballast weights (often solid plates or pellets of mild steel), although these contributions are small in relation to other sources of litter.;  On dives where there may be rock sampling, up to 65 kg of descent weight may be discarded at the seabed per dive (D.;  In addition, instruments such as current-meter moorings, markers and other scientific tools are placed on the seabed and recovered after variable periods.;  Furthermore, a small proportion of these instruments are unrecoverable and lost at sea.;  Impacts of litter on deep-sea habitats and fauna may include suffocation of animals from plastics, release of toxic chemicals, propagation of invasive species, physical damage to sessile fauna such as cold-water corals from discarded fishing gear, and ghost fishing from lost/discarded nets [59], [66], but these impacts are poorly quantified on a large geographical scale.;  The increasing evidence of continuous accumulation of litter has been recognised by the UNEP-Regional Seas initiative, which identified the need for further research on the impacts of marine litter in coastal areas [41] and with an increasing interest in deep-sea habitats (Gjerde, pers. com.).;  Current international multidisciplinary research programmes, such as the EU funded HERMIONE (Hotspot Ecosystem Research and Man's Impact on European Seas) project that investigates deep-sea ecosystem function and its contribution to production of goods and services, are incorporating studies of litter accumulation and impact.; An example of significant but localized waste was the Deep Water dumpsite 106 at bathyal depths (about 2500 m) (sedimentary slopes) along the eastern seaboard of the United States.;  Van Dover et al. [30] demonstrated incorporation of sewage-derived organic matter by benthic deposit feeders based on altered stable isotope ratios of megafauna, whilst Bothner et al. [71] showed that there were clear faunal changes at the seabed.;  Following the cessation of dumping in 1992 there was an immediate improvement in local conditions, although indicators of pollution were still measurable at 75 km down-stream [25]. There is no known dumping of sewage or dredge spoil in the deep sea at present or planned for the future, although the option has been discussed for decades [72].; In addition, deep-sea disposal of terrestrial mine tailings is a future problem for island nations, such as Papua New Guinea, where access to deep water via pipelines is feasible.;  In the early years of fishing for orange roughy off New Zealand, catches were often too large to be hauled back on board, and nets would burst spilling tens of tonnes of fish [e.g. 73], [74]. Seabird populations can benefit substantially from foraging on offal and discards [e.g. 75], [76] but the attraction of both seabirds and marine mammals (in particular seals) has become an important issue worldwide.;  This is an on-going problem for responsible fisheries, leading to devices such as bird-scarers, seal-exclusion grids, and regulations governing the discharge of offal.;  Offal from a New Zealand fishery for hoki (Macruronus novaezelandiae) was reported to reduce oxygen levels at 800 m depth [77] and possibly alter benthic community composition [78]. However, management of offal can minimise upper ocean impacts with careful disposal (e.g., only at night and away from sensitive habitat such as seamounts), using mincers to grind up the heads and bodies into small pieces, or rendering the waste into fishmeal.; Livestock transported on ships may die while at sea.;  When this occurs, the dead animals might be dumped into the ocean, contributing occasional large pulses of organic material to the seafloor, similar to other natural large-organic falls (e.g. whale falls, kelp falls).;  Whale falls deliver large pulses of organic material (40-tonne whale carcass as the typical amount) [79] to the seafloor, providing significant inputs of organic matter to the normally food-limited deep sea and being most prevalent along migration corridors of the dominant large whale species [80]. For example, hundreds of grey whales sink to the seafloor annually within an area of 8×105 km2 along the eastern Pacific [15]. This density was similar or probably larger in the 19th century, as depicted in the whale charts published by M.F.;  Maury [81], and whaling is predicted to have restricted the distribution of whale-fall colonists [82], [83]. Most animals that die at sea while being shipped die of scabby-mouth [84] and salmonellosis [85], and ‘slaughter at sea’ sometimes occurs [85]. Some vessels that carry large numbers of livestock are equipped with a macerator to grind animals that die on route, and then channel the remains straight into the sea [86]. In addition, there is evidence of diseased animals being killed and their carcasses being burnt and sunk at sea.;  Another 10,000 sheep were dumped from a ship en route between New Zealand and Saudi Arabia in 1990, and 40,000 off the coast of southern Australia [86], [87]. In July 2002, about 270,400 sheep died and where dumped at sea while en route to the Middle East [88]. The Keniry Report (2003) [85] has acknowledged that with about 300,000 sheep and 10,000 cattle being transported by sea at any time, the potential dumping of deceased animals could create a significant environmental perturbation.;  No evidence of disease transmission from dead livestock to deep-sea communities has been evaluated or recorded to date.; There has been some intentional disposal of pharmaceuticals in the deep sea.;  Between 1973 and 1978, more than 387,000 tonnes of wastes were dumped in the trench (equivalent to 880 Boeing 747s) (http://deepseanews.com/2008/04/dumping-pharmaceutical-waste-in-the-deep-sea/).;  Pharmaceutical wastes are an important issue for environmental management as they are so widely used, although their impact in the deep sea is uncertain.; More controversial has been the disposal of radioactive waste in the deep sea.;  Anthropogenic radionuclides are often elevated in deep-sea sediment [96] and midwater organisms [97] but the discovery of radioactive elements in holothurians at 5000 m from weapons testing [98] was not readily explained until the understanding of vertical flux characteristics of surface-derived phytodetritus [99]. The disposal of radioactive waste has been much more difficult to monitor.;  Although there was an active programme in the 1980s to assess the feasibility and potential impacts of high-level radioactive waste disposal in the deep sea, political considerations stopped this programme and no intentional disposal of any radioactive waste occurs in the ocean today (Tables S1 and S2).; Chemical contamination of deep-sea sediments and their effect on the fauna is still mostly unstudied.;  Although few studies are available, the recent increased sophistication of chemical analyses since the 2000s has shown that chemicals are accumulating in deep-sea sediments, benthos and midwater fauna (Table S2) [29], [103], [104]. The major contaminants of concern are persistent organic pollutants, toxic metals (e.g.;  Some xenobiotics, such as synthetic organochlofoforides used in pesticides and plastics are resistant to degradation and deep-sea sediments have been suggested as the final accumulation site for these man-made pollutants [105]. Biochemical effects of xenobiotics (i.e., induction of cytochrome P450E that catalyzes transformation of foreign compounds) were first reported in rattail fish collected from depths greater than 1000 m [106], [107]. More recent work reinforces the view that organisms and sediments of the deep sea are global sinks for persistent semi-volatile contaminants [103], [104], with bioaccufmulation and enrichment in deep-sea organisms a consequence of consumption and recycling of pre-enriched organic matter as it sinks through the water column.;  The bioaccumufolation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons by amphipods in the deep Gulf of Mexico shows differences in the concentration of these compounds in the sediment and fauna, which suggest preferential uptake of certain compounds [68]. Hydrodynamics play a major role in the accumulation of chemical pollutants in deep-sea habitats.;  Overall, the impact of persistent organic pollutants in the deep sea would appear to be low at present (Table S2), mainly because of dilution.; Ships have been lost since humans first took to the sea.;  Between 1970 and 1990, the equivalent of 18 ships and 65,000 tons of shipping sank on the high seas (excluding coastal waters) per year [25]. Both world wars would have contributed considerably more than this in both merchant and military losses [35]. To illustrate the scale, in World War II, for example, during the battle of the Atlantic, more than 175 military ships were lost and more than 3500 merchant British ships (excluding other allies) were sunk, many of them in deep water [112] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Atlantic_(1939%E2%80%931945)#Outcomes).;  Colonisation of deep-sea wrecks is difficult to quantify.;  In addition to ships, some 10,000 containers are lost overboard from ships each year, mainly as a result of storms (http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2001/06/0619_seacargo.html).;  Although some may float for weeks, many will sink to the seafloor taking their cargo with them.;  Impacts might be negative locally where the wreck/structure physically affects the seabed, but a hard substratum can increase local habitat heterogeneity providing substratum for certain species.;  A significant problem resides in ships containing munitions, as well as in discarded munitions, which, through the corrosive effect of seawater can release chemical pollutants.;  OSPAR (Commission for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic) has mapped chemical warfare components in the northeastern Atlantic [116] and a pioneer study (RED COD) has been conducted in a warfare material dumping site in the Adriatic [117]. The RED COD project showed that, although neither chemical warfare agents nor TNT were identified in tissues of the fish analysed, biomarker analyses indicated a higher stress level, higher arsenic and mercury content and gill DNA damage in the fish specimens from the dumping site compared to the non-impacted areas [117]. Taking into consideration the extent of war material dump sites worldwide [117] and the interconnectivity of oceans through hydrodynamic dispersal of particles, it is imperative that detailed studies be conducted assess local, regional and global impact of such material in the deep sea.; With increasing international interest in climate change and the recognised increase in CO2 levels in the atmosphere, methods proposed for the long term disposal of greenhouse gases include both sub-seabed disposal and surface seabed disposal [118]. The principle underlying sub-seabed disposal is that carbon dioxide (like methane) forms a solid crystalline structure at appropriate temperature and pressure conditions [119] and thus the injection of CO2 into suitable seabed structures (including past and ongoing oil and gas reservoirs) should cause the CO2 to form hydrates and hence act as a long term depository of excess CO2.;  Sleipner has stored about one million tonnes of CO2 a year at a depth of 800–1000 m below the seafloor.;  There has been no evidence of leakage so far and multinational and multidisciplinary research projects are underway to assess the CO2 state, to investigate any potential impacts and to predict the long-term destiny of the CO2[120], [121]. This existing operation, and another in the Snøhvit gas field in the Barents Sea that stores 700,000 tonnes CO2 per year at depths of 320 m, are relatively small-scale when compared with proposed industrial scale CO2 disposal, which would store about 1000 times this amount.; A simpler and cheaper option that has been considered is the direct disposal of liquid CO2 onto the deep seabed, based on the principle that a gas hydrate will be generated on the seabed.;  However, small-scale experiments have shown that fish swimming into the CO2 plume are narcotised, although they recover as they drift out of the CO2 cloud [122]. Scavenging fish and amphipods appear able to detect and avoid toxic CO2 plumes released from hydrothermal vents at the seafloor [123], while some taxa have evolved tolerances at natural deep CO2 vents [124]. Experiments on the survival of meiobenthos exposed to small-scale patches of artificially emplaced liquid CO2 show that, immediately adjacent to the CO2, pH fell and meiofauna died, whereas at control sites about 40 m distant, pH was unaltered and no meiofauna died [125]–[128]. The experiments also assessed the survival of macrofauna and megafauna (i.e. gastropods, echinoids, holothurians, cephalopods and fish) during month-long exposure to elevated CO2 levels and concluded that disposal of human-generated CO2 in the deep sea will have variable, but generally negative effects on deep-sea ecosystems.;  In particular, industrial scale CO2 disposal has the potential to create a “scavenger” sink, attracting and killing ever larger numbers of deep-sea scavengers drawn to an accumulation of dead biomass within the influence of the disposal plume [123]. An in situ experiment at more than 3000 m depth off Central California provided evidence that exposure to CO2-rich seawater is stressful for some deep-sea fauna such as harpacticoid copepods [129]. A frequently considered method of CO2 disposal with an indirect effect on the seabed is the use of iron fertilisation in areas of high nutrient low chlorophyll, to encourage phytoplankton growth, causing CO2 drawdown, with the subsequent sequestration of carbon via phytodetrital flux at depth [130]. Concerns have been raised about accompanying oxygen depletion [131]. Although iron fertilisation looks attractive in theory [132], [133] and is generating commercial interest, the amount of surface production sequestered is in the same order of magnitude as normal downward particle flux and thus relatively low [134]. Nonetheless, profound changes in ecosystem goods, services and values of the deep sea can be expected as a consequence of dumping iron into the ocean [135]. Ocean fertilisation by artificial upwelling has also been suggested to reduce the accumulation of anthropogenic carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.; Whereas in the past the main threat to the deep sea was probably the disposal of waste solids and chemicals, as well as the cascading effects of overfishing in shallow water [137], new direct threats are appearing and increasing as a result of expanding technological capabilities that permit exploitation of biological, mineral and petrochemical resources.; Technological development and market demand have both exacerbated the increasing exploitation of high-seas deepwater fisheries and the need to identify effective means of regulation to protect those fisheries and their environment [138]. Until the mid 1900s, trawling was generally restricted to the continental shelf at depths less than 200 m.;  These factors led vessels to explore progressively deeper and more distant waters and new fishery resources [e.g. 28], [139], [140]. Fisheries on the upper continental slope and deep seamounts to depths of 1500 m expanded for species like pelagic armourhead (Pseudopentaceros wheeleri), orange roughy (Hoplostethus atlanticus), alfonsino (Beryx splendens), oreos (Pseudocyttus maculatus, Allocyttus niger) and grenadiers (Coryphaenoides rupestris), but almost none of these have proven sustainable [e.g. 28], [141], [142]. This deep-sea trawling has had an impact on fish populations down to 3100 m [143], as well as by-catch species [144]. Scientific knowledge of deep-sea fish populations has tended to lag behind fisheries development, and stock depletion often has occurred before the population dynamics of the exploited species were understood enough to be used to prevent stock collapse [e.g. 145]. Overfishing issues are particularly important in deep-sea species which are often long lived, with slow growth and delayed maturity [e.g. 146], making them poorly adapted to sustain heavy fishing pressure.; The effects of trawling on benthic habitat and communities can be severe in deeper waters, especially on the upper continental slope and seamounts [147]–[149]. On a global scale, most deep-sea bottom trawling happens on sedimentary slopes.;  In the OSPAR area (northeastern Atlantic), the spatial extent of bottom trawling is orders of magnitude greater than that of submarine cables, waste disposal and oil and gas exploitation [27]. Although the communities found at habitats such as seamounts, cold-water coral reefs and cold seeps may be more vulnerable than sediment-dwelling assemblages, the impacts of fishing on seamounts and cold seeps have rarely been assessed, with significant exceptions such as in New Zealand and Australian waters.;  Trawling effort can be intense, with hundreds, or even thousands, of tows repeatedly carried out on small seamounts or cold seeps [150], [151]. Heavy trawling can reduce the diversity and biomass of benthic invertebrates, especially framework-forming foundation species like cold-water corals [152], [153]. Recovery of cold-water assemblages from fishing disturbance occurs slowly, even after fishing has ceased for 5–10 years there have been no signs of faunal recovery [154], [155]. On the deep slope of the northwestern Mediterranean, trawling for the red shrimp Aristeus antennatus has taken place for the last six decades and is now reaching 900 m depth [156]. Recent biodiversity studies in this area suggest that there are significant differences in the community structure of fished and non-fished areas, with a decrease in sessile and fragile species such as corals, sponges and echinoderms on the impacted fished seafloor [24], [157]. Hence, as in shallow water, bottom trawling has a large impact on areas of deep slope and is greater still in rocky areas or seamounts where coral is frequently found at depths of about 1000 m (Figure 4A).;  This suggests that intense trawling in certain regions needs to be taken into consideration for canyon sediment dynamics and that the gravity flows generated can have major consequences (e.g. suffocation of cold-water corals) far from the trawled area [160]. A further issue with industrial fishing is the presence of lost or discarded nets on the seafloor, which are responsible for ghost fishing affecting the benthic and benthopelagic fauna passively for years (Figure 4B).; A, Part ",,,,

; The deep sea, the largest ecosystem on Earth and one of the least studied, harbours high biodiversity and provides a wealth of resources.;  The remoteness of the deep seafloor has promoted the disposal of residues and litter.;  Thus the challenges facing the deep sea are large and accelerating, providing a new imperative for the science community, industry and national and international organizations to work together to develop successful exploitation management and conservation of the deep-sea ecosystem.;  This paper provides scientific expert judgement and a semi-quantitative analysis of past, present and future impacts of human-related activities on global deep-sea habitats within three categories: disposal, exploitation and climate change.;  The analysis shows how, in recent decades, the most significant anthropogenic activities that affect the deep sea have evolved from mainly disposal (past) to exploitation (present).;  We predict that from now and into the future, increases in atmospheric CO2 and facets and consequences of climate change will have the most impact on deep-sea habitats and their fauna.;  We identify deep-sea ecosystems we believe are at higher risk from human impacts in the near future: benthic communities on sedimentary upper slopes, cold-water corals, canyon benthic communities and seamount pelagic and benthic communities.; Deep-sea exploration began a little over 150 years ago, initially promoted by the 19th century debates on whether life occurred at depths below 300 m [1].The deep sea is considered to start at about 200 m depth, at the shelf break, where a clear change of fauna from shallow to deep water is observed [2]. The waters deeper than 200 m form the largest environment on Earth with a volume of 1368×106 km3 covering an area of 360 million km2, equivalent to about 50% of the surface of the Earth, and have an average depth of 3800 m, with a maximum depth of 10,924 m in the Mariana Trench.;  Although the first record of a deep-sea species, the ophiuroid Gorgonocephalus caputmedusae (Linnaeus, 1758) (as Astrophyton linckii, Müller & Troschel, 1842), was provided by Sir John Ross in 1818 while sounding at 1600 m in the Northwest Passage [3], robust evidence of deep-sea fauna accumulated only from 1850.;  This expedition opened a period of national deep-sea exploration that culminated in the Galathea expedition of 1950–1952, which showed that animals live at all depths, including the deepest parts of the ocean.;  At the end of this period of pioneering exploration, our understanding of the deep ocean was one of low biodiversity, no primary production, no seasonality and a uniformly cold, food-poor, dark, tranquil and invariant environment.;  It was with this scientific framework that the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) was written and signed in 1972, and the deep-sea floor of the high-seas was deemed exploitable for biological resources and sea-floor minerals.;  In the late 1960s and 1970s, increasingly sophisticated sampling methodologies with the ability to collect quantitative samples of macrofauna demonstrated that the deep sea was much more biologically diverse than originally thought.;  In 1967, Hessler and Sanders [4] documented remarkable levels of species diversity in the deep sea, with up to 365 species in a single macrofaunal sample.;  Subsequently, in 1992, Grassle and Maciolek [5] estimated that the entire deep sea might contain up to 10 million species of small invertebrates, mostly polychaetes, peracarid crustaceans and molluscs (twice as many as the estimated 5 million species in rain forests [6]).;  This estimate generated considerable debate concerning the order of magnitude of species diversity [7], [8], but the general concept that the deep sea was a highly species-rich environment was now supported by intensive sampling efforts and rigorous statistical analyses [9]. Although deep-sea species have not proven to be eurytopic (i.e. able to adapt to a wide range of environmental conditions), they may show no more stenotopy (i.e. ability to adapt only to a narrow range of environmental conditions) than is found in shallow water [10]. Thus, regional diversity could be lower than originally anticipated and the most recent estimates of total deep-sea diversity of macrofauna are considerably less than 10 million species [11]. However, further detailed sampling and analyses are necessary to describe regional diversity patterns accurately.; The late 1970s and 1980s gave rise to many exciting discoveries in the deep sea, including hydrothermal vents [12], cold seeps [13], [14], chemosynthetic ecosystems created on whale falls [15], benthic storms [16] and seasonality [17]–[19]. With the greater use of remote techniques such as multibeam swath bathymetry and seafloor imagery, habitat heterogeneity in parts of the deep sea was shown to be high.;  This heterogeneity, taken together with the vast areas of the deep sea has reinforced the concept of high biodiversity [20]–[23].; By the end of the 20th Century, the deep sea was recognised as the largest environment on Earth containing numerous sub-habitats, with unique abiotic and biological characteristics and supporting a particularly high biodiversity [24]. However, the deep sea has remained rather remote from public consciousness and the first exploitations and anthropogenic activities did not have any major social impact.;  The deep sea was (and still is) perceived as a service provider at two levels: (1) it served as a convenient site for disposal of waste, especially where land options were not politically and “ethically” attractive and (2) it was seen as a source of potential mineral and biological wealth over which there was no national jurisdiction.;  In the last decades, decreases in the amount of land-based and coastal resources combined with rapid technological development has driven increased interest in the exploration and exploitation of deep-sea goods and services, to advance at a faster pace than the acquisition of scientific knowledge of the ecosystems [25]–[27]. Evidence of this is found, for example, in the boom and bust cycle of many deep-sea fisheries in the 1970s–1980s [e.g. 28], [29], the disposal of sewage waste in deep water in the 1980s [30] and the dumping of chemical wastes and munitions [25]. Furthermore, human activities on land have promulgated a third and perhaps more dangerous level of impact: increasing atmospheric CO2 emissions that have resulted in climate change [31] – including the warming of the ocean, stratification and the generation and expansion of hypoxia – and ocean acidification [32]. A study by Halpern et al. [33] indicates that no area in the ocean is completely unaffected by anthropogenic impact and that most areas (41%) are affected by multiple drivers.;  Their model shows that coastal ecosystems receive the greatest cumulative impact, while polar regions and deep waters seem to be the least impacted [33]. Previous studies have reviewed different aspects of anthropogenic impact in the deep sea [25], [29], [34], [35], but to date little information is available on the direct and long-term effects of human activities in bathyal and abyssal ecosystems.; In this paper, we assess past, present and future impacts of human-related activities on deep-sea habitats and their communities, from disposal, through exploitation to climate change (including ocean acidification) using a semi-quantitative analytical approach.;  Studies on effects of anthropogenic impact on deep-sea habitats are still limited and often conducted at local or, at most, regional scales.;  We acknowledge this lack of global data and identify gaps that need urgent attention if we are to understand the resilience of deep-sea communities to anthropogenic stressors.;  This has proved difficult in the deep sea, as impact has often taken place before any baseline survey and the limited evidence to date suggests that the nature and extent of impacts can be variable [25], [29]. As a result, we have relied on the authors' collective and extensive experience of the deep-sea ecosystem together with the published literature, to provide a semi-quantitative scale of anthropogenic impact assessment.;  During the course of a Census of Marine Life SYNDEEP workshop (Sept. 2008), a group of 23 deep-sea researchers (see legend in Table S1) developed a scoring system to grade the effect of 28 major anthropogenic impacts grouped in 3 main categories (Table 1) on 12 deep-sea habitats (see description of habitats below).;  These discussions reflect knowledge of the current literature and the experience and judgment of the researchers involved in this study.;  After the workshop, the draft table was circulated amongst all researchers for any further input and to achieve a final check and final consensus on the scores.;  We recognize that this scoring system is subjective, but in the absence of global quantitative data, it gives some indication of future impacts on the ecosystem services provided by the deep sea.; We have conducted this analysis by dividing the deep sea according to the type of habitat.; Anthropogenic impacts are seen, intuitively, as detrimental to deep-sea organisms at various scales.;  An important factor affecting our capacity to score impact in the deep sea is our limited knowledge on biodiversity and ecosystem function for some habitats.;  These tables are intended to be modified as we understand more precisely anthropogenic impact on the deep sea.; The deep seafloor is, for most people, out of sight and therefore, often, out of mind.;  Although dumping waste and litter into the sea is now legally banned, the problem persists because of the historical accumulation of marine litter in all the world's oceans.; The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) defines marine litter as “any persistent, manufactured or processed solid material discarded, disposed of or abandoned in the marine and coastal environment”. The first intended (as opposed to accidental) disposal of waste in the deep sea predates scientific interest in this environment.;  In a survey on the nodule-free abyssal plain in the northeastern Atlantic, Kidd and Huggett [37] showed that clinker formed more than 50% of the hard substratum (the other being glacial drop stones) and that this clinker formed a suitable attachment point for the anemone Phelliactis robusta
[38] (Figure 1A), although it appears toxic to other deep-sea species.;  Highly erosive deep-sea storms, which may affect 10% of the deep-sea floor, can transport laterally sediment loads along with benthic fauna [42]. It is reasonable to assume that these storms may also transport refuse to seafloor depressions, which can serve as debris traps.;  Wood construction material and scraps of wood, bark, macrophytes and fruit that provide both habitat and nourishment to marine organisms [44]–[46] have been documented in deep-sea trawl samples periodically for at least three decades [47]–[49]. No definitive quantitative documentation, however, yet allows generalizations to be made about human generated refuse in deep-sea environments [50]. Litter is observed in almost all scientific seafloor surveys using video (e.g. remote operated vehicles, ROVs) and trawls.;  However, the amount of litter varies in different regions and no dedicated studies have been conducted to estimate the extent of litter accumulation in deep-sea habitats or to assess the effect of different litter types in the habitat and its effects on the fauna [51]. The most common litter types found on the deep–sea floor in the Mediterranean and northeastern Atlantic are soft plastic (e.g. bags), hard plastic (e.g. bottles, containers), glass and metal (e.g. tins, cans) (Figure 2A–C) [24], [52]–[55]. As part of a project investigating the biodiversity of bathyal and abyssal Mediterranean environments, 20 trawls were conducted using an otter trawl, covering a total area of 1 km2.;  Miyake et al [55] have used the JAMSTEC online deep-sea image database to conduct analysis of the occurrence and type of marine litter in the deep waters off Japan.;  Plastics are found everywhere, from land to the oceans, from the coast to the deep sea [59]. Although some types of litter are recognizable, there is accumulating evidence that “mermaids' tears” (5 mm in diameter) and microplastics (microscopic sand grain-sized particles of eroded plastic) are becoming more common in the world oceans, including the deep sea [60], [61]. While the standing stock of mega- and macro-plastics in the oceans seems to be relatively stable, the size of plastic debris is decreasing and the amount of microplastics is increasing as a function of larger plastic breakdown and an increase in primary microplastics.;  In recent years, the use of biodegradable materials was proposed as a solution to the accumulation of plastics in the environment, but in some cases, the degradable material merely disintegrated into smaller pieces that are not degradable [58]. Little is known, however, of the true effect of these particles on the environment and the fauna [62]. Several studies have shown that effects such as ingestion by invertebrates could facilitate the transport of hydrophobic contaminants [63] and the release of potentially toxic bisphenol A and PS oligomers during plastic breakdown, which can disrupt hormonal functioning and reproductive systems in the fauna [64]. Studies in the deep sea are practically nonexistent and an urgent assessment of the impact of microplastics on deep-sea fauna is needed along with the development of methods to quantify and monitor their abundance and to identify potential sources and sinks of this debris.; Scientific research using moorings, submersibles and ROVs also contributes to deep-sea litter by the dropping of ballast weights (often solid plates or pellets of mild steel), although these contributions are small in relation to other sources of litter.;  On dives where there may be rock sampling, up to 65 kg of descent weight may be discarded at the seabed per dive (D.;  In addition, instruments such as current-meter moorings, markers and other scientific tools are placed on the seabed and recovered after variable periods.;  Furthermore, a small proportion of these instruments are unrecoverable and lost at sea.;  Impacts of litter on deep-sea habitats and fauna may include suffocation of animals from plastics, release of toxic chemicals, propagation of invasive species, physical damage to sessile fauna such as cold-water corals from discarded fishing gear, and ghost fishing from lost/discarded nets [59], [66], but these impacts are poorly quantified on a large geographical scale.;  The increasing evidence of continuous accumulation of litter has been recognised by the UNEP-Regional Seas initiative, which identified the need for further research on the impacts of marine litter in coastal areas [41] and with an increasing interest in deep-sea habitats (Gjerde, pers. com.).;  Current international multidisciplinary research programmes, such as the EU funded HERMIONE (Hotspot Ecosystem Research and Man's Impact on European Seas) project that investigates deep-sea ecosystem function and its contribution to production of goods and services, are incorporating studies of litter accumulation and impact.; An example of significant but localized waste was the Deep Water dumpsite 106 at bathyal depths (about 2500 m) (sedimentary slopes) along the eastern seaboard of the United States.;  Van Dover et al. [30] demonstrated incorporation of sewage-derived organic matter by benthic deposit feeders based on altered stable isotope ratios of megafauna, whilst Bothner et al. [71] showed that there were clear faunal changes at the seabed.;  Following the cessation of dumping in 1992 there was an immediate improvement in local conditions, although indicators of pollution were still measurable at 75 km down-stream [25]. There is no known dumping of sewage or dredge spoil in the deep sea at present or planned for the future, although the option has been discussed for decades [72].; In addition, deep-sea disposal of terrestrial mine tailings is a future problem for island nations, such as Papua New Guinea, where access to deep water via pipelines is feasible.;  In the early years of fishing for orange roughy off New Zealand, catches were often too large to be hauled back on board, and nets would burst spilling tens of tonnes of fish [e.g. 73], [74]. Seabird populations can benefit substantially from foraging on offal and discards [e.g. 75], [76] but the attraction of both seabirds and marine mammals (in particular seals) has become an important issue worldwide.;  This is an on-going problem for responsible fisheries, leading to devices such as bird-scarers, seal-exclusion grids, and regulations governing the discharge of offal.;  Offal from a New Zealand fishery for hoki (Macruronus novaezelandiae) was reported to reduce oxygen levels at 800 m depth [77] and possibly alter benthic community composition [78]. However, management of offal can minimise upper ocean impacts with careful disposal (e.g., only at night and away from sensitive habitat such as seamounts), using mincers to grind up the heads and bodies into small pieces, or rendering the waste into fishmeal.; Livestock transported on ships may die while at sea.;  When this occurs, the dead animals might be dumped into the ocean, contributing occasional large pulses of organic material to the seafloor, similar to other natural large-organic falls (e.g. whale falls, kelp falls).;  Whale falls deliver large pulses of organic material (40-tonne whale carcass as the typical amount) [79] to the seafloor, providing significant inputs of organic matter to the normally food-limited deep sea and being most prevalent along migration corridors of the dominant large whale species [80]. For example, hundreds of grey whales sink to the seafloor annually within an area of 8×105 km2 along the eastern Pacific [15]. This density was similar or probably larger in the 19th century, as depicted in the whale charts published by M.F.;  Maury [81], and whaling is predicted to have restricted the distribution of whale-fall colonists [82], [83]. Most animals that die at sea while being shipped die of scabby-mouth [84] and salmonellosis [85], and ‘slaughter at sea’ sometimes occurs [85]. Some vessels that carry large numbers of livestock are equipped with a macerator to grind animals that die on route, and then channel the remains straight into the sea [86]. In addition, there is evidence of diseased animals being killed and their carcasses being burnt and sunk at sea.;  Another 10,000 sheep were dumped from a ship en route between New Zealand and Saudi Arabia in 1990, and 40,000 off the coast of southern Australia [86], [87]. In July 2002, about 270,400 sheep died and where dumped at sea while en route to the Middle East [88]. The Keniry Report (2003) [85] has acknowledged that with about 300,000 sheep and 10,000 cattle being transported by sea at any time, the potential dumping of deceased animals could create a significant environmental perturbation.;  No evidence of disease transmission from dead livestock to deep-sea communities has been evaluated or recorded to date.; There has been some intentional disposal of pharmaceuticals in the deep sea.;  Between 1973 and 1978, more than 387,000 tonnes of wastes were dumped in the trench (equivalent to 880 Boeing 747s) (http://deepseanews.com/2008/04/dumping-pharmaceutical-waste-in-the-deep-sea/).;  Pharmaceutical wastes are an important issue for environmental management as they are so widely used, although their impact in the deep sea is uncertain.; More controversial has been the disposal of radioactive waste in the deep sea.;  Anthropogenic radionuclides are often elevated in deep-sea sediment [96] and midwater organisms [97] but the discovery of radioactive elements in holothurians at 5000 m from weapons testing [98] was not readily explained until the understanding of vertical flux characteristics of surface-derived phytodetritus [99]. The disposal of radioactive waste has been much more difficult to monitor.;  Although there was an active programme in the 1980s to assess the feasibility and potential impacts of high-level radioactive waste disposal in the deep sea, political considerations stopped this programme and no intentional disposal of any radioactive waste occurs in the ocean today (Tables S1 and S2).; Chemical contamination of deep-sea sediments and their effect on the fauna is still mostly unstudied.;  Although few studies are available, the recent increased sophistication of chemical analyses since the 2000s has shown that chemicals are accumulating in deep-sea sediments, benthos and midwater fauna (Table S2) [29], [103], [104]. The major contaminants of concern are persistent organic pollutants, toxic metals (e.g.;  Some xenobiotics, such as synthetic organochlofoforides used in pesticides and plastics are resistant to degradation and deep-sea sediments have been suggested as the final accumulation site for these man-made pollutants [105]. Biochemical effects of xenobiotics (i.e., induction of cytochrome P450E that catalyzes transformation of foreign compounds) were first reported in rattail fish collected from depths greater than 1000 m [106], [107]. More recent work reinforces the view that organisms and sediments of the deep sea are global sinks for persistent semi-volatile contaminants [103], [104], with bioaccufmulation and enrichment in deep-sea organisms a consequence of consumption and recycling of pre-enriched organic matter as it sinks through the water column.;  The bioaccumufolation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons by amphipods in the deep Gulf of Mexico shows differences in the concentration of these compounds in the sediment and fauna, which suggest preferential uptake of certain compounds [68]. Hydrodynamics play a major role in the accumulation of chemical pollutants in deep-sea habitats.;  Overall, the impact of persistent organic pollutants in the deep sea would appear to be low at present (Table S2), mainly because of dilution.; Ships have been lost since humans first took to the sea.;  Between 1970 and 1990, the equivalent of 18 ships and 65,000 tons of shipping sank on the high seas (excluding coastal waters) per year [25]. Both world wars would have contributed considerably more than this in both merchant and military losses [35]. To illustrate the scale, in World War II, for example, during the battle of the Atlantic, more than 175 military ships were lost and more than 3500 merchant British ships (excluding other allies) were sunk, many of them in deep water [112] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Atlantic_(1939%E2%80%931945)#Outcomes).;  Colonisation of deep-sea wrecks is difficult to quantify.;  In addition to ships, some 10,000 containers are lost overboard from ships each year, mainly as a result of storms (http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2001/06/0619_seacargo.html).;  Although some may float for weeks, many will sink to the seafloor taking their cargo with them.;  Impacts might be negative locally where the wreck/structure physically affects the seabed, but a hard substratum can increase local habitat heterogeneity providing substratum for certain species.;  A significant problem resides in ships containing munitions, as well as in discarded munitions, which, through the corrosive effect of seawater can release chemical pollutants.;  OSPAR (Commission for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic) has mapped chemical warfare components in the northeastern Atlantic [116] and a pioneer study (RED COD) has been conducted in a warfare material dumping site in the Adriatic [117]. The RED COD project showed that, although neither chemical warfare agents nor TNT were identified in tissues of the fish analysed, biomarker analyses indicated a higher stress level, higher arsenic and mercury content and gill DNA damage in the fish specimens from the dumping site compared to the non-impacted areas [117]. Taking into consideration the extent of war material dump sites worldwide [117] and the interconnectivity of oceans through hydrodynamic dispersal of particles, it is imperative that detailed studies be conducted assess local, regional and global impact of such material in the deep sea.; With increasing international interest in climate change and the recognised increase in CO2 levels in the atmosphere, methods proposed for the long term disposal of greenhouse gases include both sub-seabed disposal and surface seabed disposal [118]. The principle underlying sub-seabed disposal is that carbon dioxide (like methane) forms a solid crystalline structure at appropriate temperature and pressure conditions [119] and thus the injection of CO2 into suitable seabed structures (including past and ongoing oil and gas reservoirs) should cause the CO2 to form hydrates and hence act as a long term depository of excess CO2.;  Sleipner has stored about one million tonnes of CO2 a year at a depth of 800–1000 m below the seafloor.;  There has been no evidence of leakage so far and multinational and multidisciplinary research projects are underway to assess the CO2 state, to investigate any potential impacts and to predict the long-term destiny of the CO2[120], [121]. This existing operation, and another in the Snøhvit gas field in the Barents Sea that stores 700,000 tonnes CO2 per year at depths of 320 m, are relatively small-scale when compared with proposed industrial scale CO2 disposal, which would store about 1000 times this amount.; A simpler and cheaper option that has been considered is the direct disposal of liquid CO2 onto the deep seabed, based on the principle that a gas hydrate will be generated on the seabed.;  However, small-scale experiments have shown that fish swimming into the CO2 plume are narcotised, although they recover as they drift out of the CO2 cloud [122]. Scavenging fish and amphipods appear able to detect and avoid toxic CO2 plumes released from hydrothermal vents at the seafloor [123], while some taxa have evolved tolerances at natural deep CO2 vents [124]. Experiments on the survival of meiobenthos exposed to small-scale patches of artificially emplaced liquid CO2 show that, immediately adjacent to the CO2, pH fell and meiofauna died, whereas at control sites about 40 m distant, pH was unaltered and no meiofauna died [125]–[128]. The experiments also assessed the survival of macrofauna and megafauna (i.e. gastropods, echinoids, holothurians, cephalopods and fish) during month-long exposure to elevated CO2 levels and concluded that disposal of human-generated CO2 in the deep sea will have variable, but generally negative effects on deep-sea ecosystems.;  In particular, industrial scale CO2 disposal has the potential to create a “scavenger” sink, attracting and killing ever larger numbers of deep-sea scavengers drawn to an accumulation of dead biomass within the influence of the disposal plume [123]. An in situ experiment at more than 3000 m depth off Central California provided evidence that exposure to CO2-rich seawater is stressful for some deep-sea fauna such as harpacticoid copepods [129]. A frequently considered method of CO2 disposal with an indirect effect on the seabed is the use of iron fertilisation in areas of high nutrient low chlorophyll, to encourage phytoplankton growth, causing CO2 drawdown, with the subsequent sequestration of carbon via phytodetrital flux at depth [130]. Concerns have been raised about accompanying oxygen depletion [131]. Although iron fertilisation looks attractive in theory [132], [133] and is generating commercial interest, the amount of surface production sequestered is in the same order of magnitude as normal downward particle flux and thus relatively low [134]. Nonetheless, profound changes in ecosystem goods, services and values of the deep sea can be expected as a consequence of dumping iron into the ocean [135]. Ocean fertilisation by artificial upwelling has also been suggested to reduce the accumulation of anthropogenic carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.; Whereas in the past the main threat to the deep sea was probably the disposal of waste solids and chemicals, as well as the cascading effects of overfishing in shallow water [137], new direct threats are appearing and increasing as a result of expanding technological capabilities that permit exploitation of biological, mineral and petrochemical resources.; Technological development and market demand have both exacerbated the increasing exploitation of high-seas deepwater fisheries and the need to identify effective means of regulation to protect those fisheries and their environment [138]. Until the mid 1900s, trawling was generally restricted to the continental shelf at depths less than 200 m.;  These factors led vessels to explore progressively deeper and more distant waters and new fishery resources [e.g. 28], [139], [140]. Fisheries on the upper continental slope and deep seamounts to depths of 1500 m expanded for species like pelagic armourhead (Pseudopentaceros wheeleri), orange roughy (Hoplostethus atlanticus), alfonsino (Beryx splendens), oreos (Pseudocyttus maculatus, Allocyttus niger) and grenadiers (Coryphaenoides rupestris), but almost none of these have proven sustainable [e.g. 28], [141], [142]. This deep-sea trawling has had an impact on fish populations down to 3100 m [143], as well as by-catch species [144]. Scientific knowledge of deep-sea fish populations has tended to lag behind fisheries development, and stock depletion often has occurred before the population dynamics of the exploited species were understood enough to be used to prevent stock collapse [e.g. 145]. Overfishing issues are particularly important in deep-sea species which are often long lived, with slow growth and delayed maturity [e.g. 146], making them poorly adapted to sustain heavy fishing pressure.; The effects of trawling on benthic habitat and communities can be severe in deeper waters, especially on the upper continental slope and seamounts [147]–[149]. On a global scale, most deep-sea bottom trawling happens on sedimentary slopes.;  In the OSPAR area (northeastern Atlantic), the spatial extent of bottom trawling is orders of magnitude greater than that of submarine cables, waste disposal and oil and gas exploitation [27]. Although the communities found at habitats such as seamounts, cold-water coral reefs and cold seeps may be more vulnerable than sediment-dwelling assemblages, the impacts of fishing on seamounts and cold seeps have rarely been assessed, with significant exceptions such as in New Zealand and Australian waters.;  Trawling effort can be intense, with hundreds, or even thousands, of tows repeatedly carried out on small seamounts or cold seeps [150], [151]. Heavy trawling can reduce the diversity and biomass of benthic invertebrates, especially framework-forming foundation species like cold-water corals [152], [153]. Recovery of cold-water assemblages from fishing disturbance occurs slowly, even after fishing has ceased for 5–10 years there have been no signs of faunal recovery [154], [155]. On the deep slope of the northwestern Mediterranean, trawling for the red shrimp Aristeus antennatus has taken place for the last six decades and is now reaching 900 m depth [156]. Recent biodiversity studies in this area suggest that there are significant differences in the community structure of fished and non-fished areas, with a decrease in sessile and fragile species such as corals, sponges and echinoderms on the impacted fished seafloor [24], [157]. Hence, as in shallow water, bottom trawling has a large impact on areas of deep slope and is greater still in rocky areas or seamounts where coral is frequently found at depths of about 1000 m (Figure 4A).;  This suggests that intense trawling in certain regions needs to be taken into consideration for canyon sediment dynamics and that the gravity flows generated can have major consequences (e.g. suffocation of cold-water corals) far from the trawled area [160]. A further issue with industrial fishing is the presence of lost or discarded nets on the seafloor, which are responsible for ghost fishing affecting the benthic and benthopelagic fauna passively for years (Figure 4B).; A, Part ",,,,

; A summer bather entering a calm sea from the beach may sense alternating warm and cold water.;  This can be felt when moving forward into the sea (‘vertically homogeneous’ and ‘horizontally different’), but also when standing still between one’s feet and body (‘vertically different’).;  Such motions are common in the deep ocean, but generally not in shallow seas where turbulent mixing is expected strong enough to homogenize.;  Human thermoception starts at 0.5–1°C T-difference, from physiology experiments of small body-surfaces around 32°C [1]–[3], but body cooling reduces local thermal sensitivity [4]. However, regular beach visitors in countries like the Netherlands (Tw≤20°C) confirm: slow minute-like T-variations can be sensed, when seas are calm.; As seas (and oceans) are heated from above and warm water is less dense (“lighter”) than cold water, they are generally stably stratified in density.;  A stratified sea supports motions in its interior that basically go unnoticed at the sea surface: internal waves (IW) which propagate much slower but with much larger amplitudes than surface wind waves (SWW).;  Until day 180.26 (06:30 UTC; 08:30 LT) humidity was 100%, wind speed |W|<2 m s−1, air temperature Ta<Tw and in sea no T-differences were observed (Fig. 2).;  Potentially stratification counteracting, fresh ground water leakage is found little important, as it would generate free convection in the overlying saltier sea water, hence complete homogenizing.;  The black dashed curves indicate the predicted tidal sea-level height variation (sensors in air above it) and the yellow bar on the left spread of surface wind wave height, estimated from the water surface passing T-sensors.; T-observations in the sea (Fig. 2a) varied between 17.05 and 18.97°C (in saturated to the right).;  As soon as Ta>Tw, well-stratified water passed T-sensors that were now all below surface (at HW sea level is about 0.90 m above the highest sensor).;  Such 0.5–1°C temperature differences were sensed by team members, regularly swimming or standing in the sea near the pole without disturbing the measurements (Fig. 1b).;  This mixing is likely driven following nighttime air-sea interaction.;  The beach observations resemble, in IW-groups, IW-asymmetry and KH-billows, much larger (10–40 m high) IW-breaking over deep-ocean large topography [15], [19]: this suggests beach-IW shoal coming in from the open sea possibly generated over the undulating sloping bottom; except that IW-beach-turbulence is smaller in magnitude.; From this beach experiment we learn that commonly rugged shallow seas like the southern North Sea can stratify during brief periods and are not well-mixed year-round, which is somewhat in contrast with predictions for seasonal stratification variations using bulk parameters [21]. This small-scale stratification hampers vertical turbulent mixing on the one hand but also supports motions in its interior, which generate sufficient vertical exchange, e.g., to maintain growth in the photic zone.; Using high-resolution T-sensors we have evidenced that the Italian mothers are right, of course, in sensing natural variability in the sea interior.;  Already in a cool sea such variations need only be 0.5–1°C to be sensed by humans.",sea,water,,up
21525990,3078123,"Predictive habitat models are increasingly being used by conservationists, researchers and governmental bodies to identify vulnerable ecosystems and species' distributions in areas that have not been sampled.;  However, in the deep sea, several limitations have restricted the widespread utilisation of this approach.;  These range from issues with the accuracy of species presences, the lack of reliable absence data and the limited spatial resolution of environmental factors known or thought to control deep-sea species' distributions.;  To address these problems, global habitat suitability models have been generated for five species of framework-forming scleractinian corals by taking the best available data and using a novel approach to generate high resolution maps of seafloor conditions.;  Numerous small scale features (i.e., seamounts), which have not been sampled or identified as having a high probability of supporting cold-water coral habitat were identified in all ocean basins.; One of the most enigmatic groups of deep-sea organisms are framework-forming cold-water corals.;  Compared to many other deep-sea ecosystems, cold-water corals are relatively well researched, but still face significant threats from human activities [1], [2], [3]. Their susceptibility to anthropogenic impacts and slow rates of recovery from disturbance has led to an increasing awareness that cold-water coral ecosystems deserve full protection both within countries' Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) and on the high seas.;  Predictive habitat modelling is increasingly being used as a cost effective tool to identify where vulnerable marine ecosystems (VMEs) could occur and to provide insight into the environmental drivers that control their distribution [4], [5], [6], [7]. The enormous costs associated with the operation of remotely operated vehicles (ROVs), submersibles, and ships with multibeam capability reinforce the need for well developed predictive habitat models to guide research, conservation and management initiatives.; In this manuscript, ‘reefs’ are defined as biogenic structures formed by azooxanthellate scleractinian corals that alter sediment deposition, provide complex structural habitat and are subject to periodic growth and (bio)erosion [2], [3]. Cold-water coral reefs can be many meters in height, kilometres in length and provide important habitat and nursery areas for many species, including commercially important fish species [2]. Six species of Scleractinia are known to form reef frameworks in the deep sea, Enallopsammia rostrata, Goniocorella dumosa, Lophelia pertusa, Madrepora oculata, Oculina varicosa and Solenosmilia variabilis
[8]. There has been significant bias towards L. pertusa particularly with respect to research and management, driven in part by the extent, accessibility and it's prominence as a flagship species for deep-sea conservation [1]. This is especially evident in the North Atlantic, where L. pertusa is the dominant framework-forming species.;  Madrepora oculata often occurs as a secondary framework-former growing in tandem with species such as L. pertusa and G. dumosa
[8]. Similarly, E. rostrata is also found associated with L. pertusa, M. oculata and/or S. variabilis and can form massive dendroid colonies up to 1 m thick [8]. Oculina varicosa is unusual in that it is found both in shallow waters (<50 m with algal symbionts) and in the deep sea where it is azoozanthellate (depth range is ∼50 to 100 m).;  In the deep sea, O. varicosa forms tall, fragile reefs that can reach 35 m in height [9]. Goniocorella dumosa is mostly found in the southern hemisphere and is a dominant framework-former in New Zealand waters [10]. Solenosmilia variabilis has a cosmopolitan distribution, but has not been found in the Antarctic, north Pacific or east Pacific [10].;  Their slow growth rate, fragility, and longevity (i.e. some L. pertusa reefs in the North Atlantic were dated to 4550 years old [11]) make them particularly vulnerable to human activities including: bottom-contact fishing activity [11], [12], hydrocarbon extraction and exploration [3] and the emerging threat of seabed mining [13]. Perhaps more severe, is the threat ocean acidification poses to cold-water coral reef ecosystems [14]. Such a pervasive range of impacts and the long recovery periods of these organisms has led to global efforts to conserve these ecosystems.;  One such mechanism was put forward in 2006 by the United Nations General Assembly, calling upon member states and regional fisheries management organisations to halt bottom-contact fishing in high seas areas where seamounts, hydrothermal vents, and cold-water corals are known or are likely to occur based on the best available scientific information (UN GA, Draft resolution of the 61st session of the General Assembly, 6th December 2006, A/61/L.38).;  Participating states could not reach consensus on the bottom trawling moratorium, but there is growing international support for habitat suitability modelling in the deep sea.; Several studies have been conducted that utilise a range of different presence-only habitat suitability modelling techniques on deep-sea species [4], [5], [6], [7], [15], [16]. However, there have been no major developments in addressing many of the current limitations of predictive modelling in the deep sea.;  The lack of environmental data at high resolutions is perhaps the greatest limitation to deep-sea modelling efforts [4], [6]. To address this, studies have focused on improving local-scale habitat suitability modelling by integrating digital terrain variables derived from multibeam bathymetry [5], [16], [17]. Whilst this approach produces valuable data on species distributions in localised areas (1–100 km2), it requires intensive and often expensive sampling techniques be conducted prior to modelling the area (e.g. multibeam bathymetry and video surveys).;  Regional and global scale models are needed to predict habitat suitability for corals in areas that have not been surveyed and produced at spatial resolutions sufficient to guide research vessels towards clearly defined areas for sampling activity.;  The 30-arc second environmental database, presented here, generates representations of seafloor conditions, which can be highly variable over small spatial scales.;  For z-binned datasets, it was assumed that the conditions found at a specific gridded depth were representative of conditions at that area of seafloor.;  This allows for the creation of continuous representations of seafloor conditions by extrapolating each z-bin to the corresponding area of seafloor at that depth using an up-scaling approach.; Converting the z-binned datasets into representations of seafloor conditions involved several processes.;  Thirdly, each resampled z-bin was then draped over the area of seafloor that corresponded to its depth range.;  Each of these bins did not overlap, and were finally merged to produce a continuous representation of the variable at the seafloor.;  Surface productivity values were obtained from the Vertically Generalised Productivity Model (VGPM, [27]) and MODIS chlorophyll a data (years 2002–2007), and particulate organic carbon flux to the seafloor was obtained from Lutz et al. [26]. Terrain variables were calculated using ESRI's ArcGIS 9.3 Spatial Analyst extension or the Benthic Terrain Modeler (BTM) extension [28] using SRTM30 bathymetry.;  Variables were selected based on a literature search of environmental factors known or thought to influence cold-water coral growth and survival.;  Most species were restricted to depths shallower than 1500 m, but there were some records (11%) that were found much deeper and are likely to be errors in the reporting of the species' position, especially on seamounts or steep slopes.;  Predicted coral habitat in the Indian Ocean, Central Pacific, and Southern Atlantic was largely limited to large seamounts (>1 km in diameter) and deep slopes of oceanic islands.;  On a global scale, both continental margins and seamounts are known to be important areas for deep-sea scleractinian reef-formers (Figures 5, ​,77 and S7).;  However, there are likely many smaller seamounts (<1 km in diameter) that were not detected in the models.; a) E. rostrata around New Zealand and Australia, b) G. dumosa around New Zealand and Australia, c) S. variabilis on seamounts in the Southern Ocean south of Madagascar.;  In contrast to E. rostrata, G. dumosa was less prevalent on large seamounts (Figures 5c, ​,6b6b and S9).;  The majority of L. pertusa habitat was predicted on continental shelves and slopes, with less suitable habitat predicted on seamounts.;  The distribution of suitable habitat for M. oculata was similar to L. pertusa, but was more prevalent on large seamounts (Figures 5e and Figure S11).;  Finally, suitable habitat for S. variabilis appears throughout the world's oceans, but was largely restricted to large seamounts and in the waters surrounding New Zealand.; This study improves significantly on previous global and regional modelling efforts such as those by Davies et al. [4] and Tittensor et al. [6]. The up-scaling approach used to characterise seafloor conditions at 30-arc second spatial resolution resulted in a global database of environmental, chemical and physical variables, which could be used to predict the distributions of non-coral deep-sea taxa.;  The increase in spatial resolution resulted in significantly more presence records being included in the models than in previous studies [4]. However, despite the advantages of this approach there are still several limitations and constraints that must be recognised in modelling deep-sea organisms at global scales (see below).;  Coarse resolution models miss important bathymetric features such as seamounts and canyons, which are known to harbour well developed cold-water scleractinian ecosystems.;  Depth can vary considerably over small spatial scales and these undersea features must be captured in modelling efforts.;  Monthly or seasonal time series are often made available, but suffer from reduced sample numbers that increases the uncertainty in the data.;  Fourthly, the up-scaling procedure generalises conditions for a given area of seafloor and did not incorporate small scale oceanographic variability such as upwelling or downwelling on seamounts or banks, which is probably not captured in source data with low native resolutions (Figure 3).;  On the whole, these minor errors do not distract from the capability of the up-scaling approach to produce fairly accurate representations of conditions on the seafloor (Figure 8), but care must be taken when interpreting the modelled habitat suitability in areas where the environmental data may be less reliable (Figure 3).;  Note the significant increase in spatial resolution and ability to identify suitable habitat on seamounts off Portugal.;  Similarly, current velocity and direction also vary considerably over small spatial scales [46]. For example, on the Jasper Seamount in the Pacific, octocorals are more abundant near peaks and on small-scale topography such as knobs and pinnacles compared with mid-slope sites at similar depths [47]. It is likely that this is also true of scleractinian corals on seamounts, as previous observations amongst reefs have shown them to be largely found on undersea features where encounters with food particles are maximised [46], [48]. Cold-water scleractinian corals also appear to be adversely affected by heavy sedimentation and consequently areas with high sediment loads and soft bottoms may not be suitable for coral colonisation or survival [49]. For local and regional scale modelling, it is important that substrate, current velocity/direction and sediment data be included when available.;  Several recent studies have investigated the effectiveness and reliability of habitat suitability models constructed with low numbers of presences, a common problem for difficult to detect species (i.e. cold-water corals) and those that have had limited systematic survey effort such as records from museum collections [54]. This does not preclude the possibility of modelling species distributions with low sample numbers, as Maxent is capable of producing good models with as few as five presences [37]. However, Maxent does appear to overpredict suitable habitat when using small presence datasets compared with other methods [37], [55]. In this study, the amount of presence records for E. rostrata and G. dumosa were comparatively lower than the other species, but this study has used more presence records than previous global deep-sea habitat suitability models [4], [6].; Depth, temperature, salinity and aragonite saturation state accounted for the highest contributions to coral habitat predictions and agree with findings from previous studies into cold-water coral distributions [4], [6], [56]. Particulate organic carbon (POC) was expected to be an important variable as cold-water corals are sessile filter feeders dependent on organic matter falling from the surface or advected via currents that bring organic matter and zooplankton to the coral [57]. The majority of coral records retained in this analysis were located in areas with relatively low POC flux, which suggests several hypotheses. 1) That cold-water scleractinians may not be as dependent on high surface productivity as suggested by Guinotte et al. [14], as food may be transported into coral areas from adjacent waters with higher productivity. 2) The cold-water species included in this analysis have relatively low nutritional requirements or 3) the input data does not accurately capture the POC reaching the seafloor.;  Further research into the nutritional requirements of cold-water scleractinians is required to satisfy these hypotheses.; Field validation of modelled habitat is needed to 1) assess the accuracy of model predictions, 2) refine models by identifying false positives, and 3) gauge the utility of these methods for identifying cold-water coral habitat in unsurveyed areas for management action (i.e. the high seas).;  They are more useful in directing research effort to areas that have the highest probability of supporting framework-forming cold-water corals.;  To address this limitation, and to improve the probability of locating undiscovered coral areas, research ships should first use multibeam surveys (in high probability areas) to identify substrate characteristics that can support framework-forming cold-water coral growth or identify corals (e.g. emergent hard substrata, coral rubble).; The high costs associated with sampling and surveying in the deep sea virtually assures that detailed surveys of all of the world's oceans will not be economically feasible.;  The up-scaling approach presented here resulted in a high resolution database of global seafloor conditions that could be used to model habitats for numerous deep-sea species.;  The habitat predictions and database are a significant enhancement over earlier research [4], [6], and illustrates the potential for improving our knowledge of potential cold-water coral distributions and the factors that control their distribution using existing data.;  Regional scale models for predicting cold-water coral habitat at higher resolutions (∼90 m) are currently in development for the southeast and west coasts of the USA and represent the next step in developing predictive modelling as a valuable technique for the management of deep-sea species.",sea,water,,up
